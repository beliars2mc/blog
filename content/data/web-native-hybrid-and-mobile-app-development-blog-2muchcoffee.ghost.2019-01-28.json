it addresses a lot of problems for the implementations and customers by doing the websites rapid, serviceable, esthetic and SEO friendly at once.\\nFull of efficient functionality and features sets [AngularJS](https://2muchcoffee.com/angular-web-development) and [Node.js](https://2muchcoffee.com/nodejs-development) are very useful for  sure. That's why the most profitable companies have taken an advantage of it. And now I'd like to tell you about the benefits and futuristics causes using the JavaScript.\\nIn more details I will tell you about the process of implementing AngularJS and Node.js on the part of client and server in the high-speed sites.

It was built a system that encourage online shopping using speech command. Node.js has an event triggered, non-blocking I/O model. It is well befitting for Alexa as then has trigger based input and it is one of the highest  ecological open system  source libraries. Alexa can work  quietly with Node.js and AWS Lambda to manage the trigger set up by  event.\\nApprox Traffic in November 2017 : 2.91 Billion\\n\\n### 4.

Ebay\\n\\n![eBay---Best-10-AngularJS-and-Node.js---2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/04/eBay---Best-10-AngularJS-and-Node.js---2muchcoffee.jpg)\\n\\nEbay is a website with  a huge traffic of 168 millions users which have been active in the first quarter of 2017 and still are using it. This website was built using Node.js(1.74B). The inventors decided to use Node.js to build  their JavaScript backend to deal with such amount of real-time requests. According to the interview of Steven Luan, a software engineer at eBay, the e-commerce giant has always been open to new decisions of different problems and Node.js is the most effective. In the same time Java was considered as non-effective due to experiments of eBay engineers. So that they started using Node.js.\\n\\n### 6.

Let us concentrate on pitfalls of Angular which are mentioned by other developers to know what can go wrong. The list usually includes:\\n\\n- Big bundle sizes and thus slow apps (especially when targeting mobile use).

In the constantly changing landscape of frontend development, even 6 months is a decade. The latest version available at the moment is Angular 5, while version 6 was announced to be released in less than half a year.\\nThe gradual improvements Angular received starting from Angular 2 release addressed all of the problems mentioned above. Can you imagine that?\\n\\n## Is Angular 2+ production environment ready?\\n\\nLet me try to convince you Angular is ready for production environment.\\n\\nOne of the most widespread misconceptions about Angular is related to the size of the framework itself and the size of bundles it generates.\\nAngular has several concepts for creating effective apps and one of the main ones is the modular approach. The application has one main core module and optional modules responsible for different functionality. Using small modules allow implementing lazy loading and dependency injection techniques at runtime to build large distributed applications. It’s all about keeping initial payload small, loading only necessary parts of an application to allow users interact with the interface immediately.\\n\\n![Angular-effective-apps---2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/04/Angular-effective-apps---2muchcoffee.png)\\n\\nWhat about available versions? You must have heard there are many major Angular releases that can be quite discouraging as usually in other projects each major version breaks compatibility. That’s what happened after the release of Angular 2. But Google development team definitely wanted to avoid this situation. Now Angular 2, 4 and 5 are better described as different releases of one and the same version of Framework called just Angular. All compatible and projects started in version 2 can be upgraded to version 5 without too much effort.\\n\\n![Angular-update-line---2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/04/Angular-update-line---2muchcoffee.png)\\n\\nI am sure you want your JavaScript-based application to be fast. Have you even wondered what are the main phases of JS code execution? You need to download the code, uncompress it, parse and compile before running locally in the browser. Can Angular propose any improvement here? Absolutely yes! Version 5 made AoT compilation the default one. AoT means that server precompiles application before browser downloads it. That’s an impressed gain in loading speed as an app can be rendered almost immediately after downloading.\\n\\n![Compiling-in-Angular-2--AOT----2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/04/Compiling-in-Angular-2--AOT----2muchcoffee.png)\\n\\nThe lack of state management is often mentioned as a drawback of Angular. All modern apps need it to control and save different types of states like local UI, server responses, user preferences, etc. How can Angular not have it, if it’s absolutely required? This is one more misconception about the framework! Angular supports Flux, Redux, RxJS, Immutable.js thanks to unidirectional data flow design pattern.\\n\\nIt seems that Angular allows to create fast, small but still modern and functional applications. Is it hard to build them? Well, after the introduction of angular-cli it’s much easier. You can have everything under control using one command line tool: start a new application, generate its parts like Angular components, directives, routes, services, etc., serve it in a browser and build it. No more complex environments with many interrelated parts that should be set and configured before you can even create “Hello World”. Angular-cli (at the moment version 1.7.4) is fast, stable and unified. Ready for production usage.\\n\\nHave you heard about the headaches making Angular apps SEO compatible? Maybe you were also told about server-side rendering problems? That has all gone away when Angular Universal was created. Its idea is to create an application that runs on the server and has everything intact with the client side. Universal is a middleware that sits between Nodejs and Angular. If not diving deep into technical description it’s possible to say that it offers to create single page applications with SEO friendless static pages have.\\n\\n![Angular-Universal-SEO----2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/04/Angular-Universal-SEO----2muchcoffee.png)\\n\\nOf course Angular offers much more than that. For instance, version 5 has proposed new modern library for handling HTTP requests, optimized build process, offered better support for creating progressive web apps that can look as native mobile applications. There are many other improvements which lift Angular into the Olymp or JS frameworks fully ready to build production sites.\\n\\nWe have discussed many of the misconceptions about Angular and revealed they are not valid. This framework provides many out of the box features to build maintainable and effective applications.

I believe everybody agrees that a framework should be\nstable, have an immense ecosystem, get support from a developers community and\nhave skills proposal on the job market. When thinking about applications nobody\nwill argue they should be small and blazingly fast. If you ask web developers\nabout desired framework features, they usually mention clear and clean code,\nstraightforward application structure, possibility of easy upgrade between\nversions and codebase extensibility.\n\nThere are many different options to choose as the frontend JavaScript framework.\nFor now, let’s concentrate on Angular. So the question is are modern versions of\nAngular ready for production or there are more mature projects?\n\nExamples of Angular 2+ ecommerce websites\n2muchcoffee team has completed dozens of ecommerce building projects and others\nusing Angular 2 and its newer versions. We trust our experience that Angular\ne-commerce solution is ready for production. But let’s look at others, what big\nprojects use Angular for their brand or SaaS? Check out \nhttps://www.madewithangular.com/, it has an increasing number of Angular sites\nexamples that you may know. Among them Nasdaq, Walmart Grocery, Virgin Mobile\nUSA and Microsoft Support. Without even mentioning Google projects that are\nalready using Angular or are being gradually transferred to it.\n\n\n\nAlright, some companies use it for their production websites, but it’s still not\nthe most convincing factor. Perhaps we can find feedback from the developers who\nalready tried Angular? For sure we can! There are a lot of opinions about using\nGoogle made JS framework. Let us concentrate on pitfalls of Angular which are\nmentioned by other developers to know what can go wrong. The list usually\nincludes:\n\n * Big bundle sizes and thus slow apps (especially when targeting mobile use).\n   Often referring to the size of Angular itself as a drawback of the -\n   platform.\n * Instability of components and breaking changes in new versions.\n * Absence of state management and incompatibility with Redux or Flux\n * Complicated build process\n * Inability to create Angular SEO friendly single page websites\n\nIt sounds quite serious and Angular seems to be too massive and complicated. You\nmay not like to use it for your website, right? But if we look closer we can\nnotice all these comments refer to RC versions of Angular 2 mainly if not the\nvery first version of the framework - now called AngularJS. In the constantly\nchanging landscape of frontend development, even 6 months is a decade. The\nlatest version available at the moment is Angular 5, while version 6 was\nannounced to be released in less than half a year.\nThe gradual improvements Angular received starting from Angular 2 release\naddressed all of the problems mentioned above. Can you imagine that?\n\nIs Angular 2+ production environment ready?\nLet me try to convince you Angular is ready for production environment.\n\nOne of the most widespread misconceptions about Angular is related to the size\nof the framework itself and the size of bundles it generates.\nAngular has several concepts for creating effective apps and one of the main\nones is the modular approach. The application has one main core module and\noptional modules responsible for different functionality. Using small modules\nallow implementing lazy loading and dependency injection techniques at runtime\nto build large distributed applications. It’s all about keeping initial payload\nsmall, loading only necessary parts of an application to allow users interact\nwith the interface immediately.\n\n\n\nWhat about available versions? You must have heard there are many major Angular\nreleases that can be quite discouraging as usually in other projects each major\nversion breaks compatibility. That’s what happened after the release of Angular\n2. But Google development team definitely wanted to avoid this situation. Now\nAngular 2, 4 and 5 are better described as different releases of one and the\nsame version of Framework called just Angular. All compatible and projects\nstarted in version 2 can be upgraded to version 5 without too much effort.\n\n\n\nI am sure you want your JavaScript-based application to be fast. Have you even\nwondered what are the main phases of JS code execution? You need to download the\ncode, uncompress it, parse and compile before running locally in the browser.\nCan Angular propose any improvement here? Absolutely yes! Version 5 made AoT\ncompilation the default one. AoT means that server precompiles application\nbefore browser downloads it. That’s an impressed gain in loading speed as an app\ncan be rendered almost immediately after downloading.\n\n\n\nThe lack of state management is often mentioned as a drawback of Angular. All\nmodern apps need it to control and save different types of states like local UI,\nserver responses, user preferences, etc. How can Angular not have it, if it’s\nabsolutely required? This is one more misconception about the framework! Angular\nsupports Flux, Redux, RxJS, Immutable.js thanks to unidirectional data flow\ndesign pattern.\n\nIt seems that Angular allows to create fast, small but still modern and\nfunctional applications. Is it hard to build them? Well, after the introduction\nof angular-cli it’s much easier. You can have everything under control using one\ncommand line tool: start a new application, generate its parts like Angular\ncomponents, directives, routes, services, etc., serve it in a browser and build\nit. No more complex environments with many interrelated parts that should be set\nand configured before you can even create “Hello World”. Angular-cli (at the\nmoment version 1.7.4) is fast, stable and unified. Ready for production usage.\n\nHave you heard about the headaches making Angular apps SEO compatible? Maybe you\nwere also told about server-side rendering problems? That has all gone away when\nAngular Universal was created. Its idea is to create an application that runs on\nthe server and has everything intact with the client side. Universal is a\nmiddleware that sits between Nodejs and Angular. If not diving deep into\ntechnical description it’s possible to say that it offers to create single page\napplications with SEO friendless static pages have.\n\n\n\nOf course Angular offers much more than that. For instance, version 5 has\nproposed new modern library for handling HTTP requests, optimized build process,\noffered better support for creating progressive web apps that can look as native\nmobile applications. There are many other improvements which lift Angular into\nthe Olymp or JS frameworks fully ready to build production sites.\n\nWe have discussed many of the misconceptions about Angular and revealed they are\nnot valid. This framework provides many out of the box features to build\nmaintainable and effective applications. It’s more like a platform that has\nsolutions for almost each and every aspect of frontend development. Having many\ncompetitors Angular absorbs best ideas which prove their effectiveness and is\nnow at the front line of web development.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/04/ecommerce-website-built-with-angular---2muchcoffee.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Production websites built with Angular 2+ are increased with E-commerce now","meta_description":"Angular Universal provides solution for SEO building Angular e-commerce websites.

When you decide to create your app as a website, native, or hybrid mobile app, it's important to identify all the aspects in this area. Number-one choice will not be declared here, though a comparing of  three concepts, representing all the strong and  weak points from the company's point of view which are aimed to evolve a mobile application will be offered.\\n\\n## Web Applications\\n\\n![web-app-development---2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/05/web-app-development---2muchcoffee.jpg)\\n\\nWeb apps are stored in browsers. Do they have any distinction of a site? Usually sites are packed with material much more than apps due to usability  prioritization. \\n\\nNevertheless, web applications do not demand uploading from device stores. They can be reached through internet browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Moreover, your device memory will be safe. We consider web applications just like a technology which breaks down the borders among web, native and hybrid mobile applications. Nowadays it’s almost impossible to detect the difference between web applications hybrid mobile applications or native ones, especially when it comes to adaptive or responsive design.\\n\\nAn app uploaded from the app store which is seemed to be a native according to all signs, it appears to be a webview as a result ( based on a native language again ) including the URL to a web .The biggest part of the code is performed out of a native language. For someone it satisfies their needs, for others it’s the other form of a web application. Hence the conclusion is that web app is a website that feels native without the necessity of being downloaded. \\n\\n## How do you Build a Web App?\\n\\nIn general, web applications are built in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5 and operated within most common Web browsers. Developers usually work with a custom pattern instead of using the software development sets. In case you'd like to go with a web app, it will be fast and straight though consider it might have less functionality comparing to native ones. \\n\\n[Progressive Web Applications](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development) are the mix of web apps and native ones. Despite the shortage of some specific features that are common to mobile apps like push messages, offline mode, web apps made a decent breakthrough toward  the latest technologies. \\n\\nJust appreciate these new capabilities of WPA:\\n-  Push notifications delivering;\\n-  Swipe gesture and device motion sensor;\\n-  Ability to reach phone’s hardware.\\n\\nThough the biggest drawback still exists. Only Google Chrome users can enjoy their WPA. iOS owners can only patiently wait for such opportunity so far. \\n\\n*Pros:*\\n-  Simplicity in developing;\\n-  Simplicity in supporting;\\n-  Reasonable cost;\\n-  Same codebase for all platforms as long as they use required technology. \\n\\n*Cons:*\\n-  It always works through URL, that means always more time to spend to run the app;\\n-  Lack of speed when it comes to performance;\\n-  Using the app might be more confusing as they don’t have usual design or functionality;\\n-  There is no thumbnail on the screen, only bookmark in browser;\\n-  Inability to use all device capabilities. \\n\\n## Native applications\\n\\n![native-app-development---2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/05/native-app-development---2muchcoffee.jpg)\\n\\nLet's find out what is a native app? The Native applications are the most popular kind of applications. Each native application is developed for a particular operating system with a specific demanded language, for example, Swift and Objective-C are always for iPhone applications, Java or Kotlin would be for Android, etc. Also, Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will be needed to start developing a native app. Both of the  companies monolithes Apple and Google give their own widget elements, SDK, and development tools. That's the main reason as well as many other advantages make product owners focus on building native apps. \\n\\n*There are certain pros:*\\n-  Native applications work quick and qualitatively cause they were  created for a particular system;\\n-  Usability is always much more than expected;\\n-  Usually they can be found in devices’ markets;\\n-  The level of their interactivity is much higher. Moreover they perform much convenient in question of cooperation with user;\\n-  They provide the access to the full internal features and functions of the platform with no dependence of system’s performance optimizations;\\n-  Offline mode is supported;\\n-  It performs much natural for user as it relies on specific UI standards for each system and platform.\\n\\n*And cons as well:*\\n-  More complicated learning curve, so developers should be qualified enough; \\n-  More financially consuming;\\n-  It is not the best solution to build a small app as Native one.\\n\\nNevertheless web apps aren’t able to get the access to device’s features; mobile apps have to be periodically updated from the stores to improve their effectiveness. In the same time web apps can be updated itself automatically. Moreover, native app development makes you able to get direct access to all native frameworks that are not available with other types of development.\\n\\nDespite the budget may be higher to build a native app, your result will be saving a lot of money and time in a long perspective. Also you can provide your users with a better performance and effectiveness of your app. By all means the mix of advantages of native apps leads to a higher level of positive feedbacks and users loyalty.\\n\\n**Another point of view**\\n\\nUsing native, as it was written above, you have to create an app for every operating system separately. So that new technologies were released – Xamarin and React Native.\\n\\n**Xamarin** was developed by Microsoft and it gives a possibility to build one program on C# which will work on many platforms. It is an open code language, so users may share code with each other and use all the content of C# code database.\\n\\nFacebook - the most popular social networking company nowadays- modeled and released technology that became in demand very fast. **React** gave the ability to cover all mobile platforms with the same codebase. It is quite the same feeling as you use an app written in Objective-C or Java, but instead it’s build in JavaScript and React.\\n\\nThe term “native” may be explained as a system which is tailored to work on a particular platform. Xamarin or [React Native](https://2muchcoffee.com/react-development) technologies are quite crosscutting and could be also defined as hybrid. The reason is, for example, that Xamarin builds native apps for iPhone, Windows and Android apps in C#, and can be created either in Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio. Moreover, it creates hybrid mobile apps for various systems with the same C# codebase,development environment, language, and Application Programming Interfaces. Nevertheless, because of an additional level between code and the platform, it’s considered as hybrid.\\n\\n## Hybrid Apps\\n\\n![hybrid-app-development---2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/05/hybrid-app-development---2muchcoffee.jpg)\\n\\nSuch mobile applications are able to work on different platforms same as native apps do due to built-in browser environment. A hybrid app pieces together a mix of a native and a web features. Customers may install it on their devices, nevertheless, it is still actually a web application. These types of apps are usually built using HTML, Javascript, CSS, and a Webview is used to run it.\\n\\n[Hybrid app development](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development) functions comprise the same potential as HTML5. What is more, it also includes native app benefits. Intermediary wrapper gives such an opportunity as translating instructions into a form that the mobile device understands in order to access hardware capabilities of your device.\\nA hybrid app comprises the back-end part (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and the native part (which is for downloading and includes the code on Webview).\\n\\n*Pros*\\n- It is built with HTML/ CSS/ Javascript to make the process easier;\\n- Less expensive than a native app;\\n- PhoneGap, Cordova allow run it on multiple platforms;\\n- No dependency on specific browser;\\n- Device’s storage, internal APIs, camera, etc become reachable;\\n- You have a single codebase so it is less time consuming to build.\\n\\n*Cons*\\n- Performance is more idle;\\n- Third-party service integration to wrap;\\n- Cordova apps are behind in interaction;\\n- Customization will bring you more to a native model.\\n\\nCreating hybrid apps, you must deal with such problems as some particular features of both native and hybrid systems that make issues much more difficult to solve. The performance is a disadvantage as well because of loading in webview. The practice shows that hybrid app is not that user-friendly often as it is impossible to customize based on the platform.\\n\\nAnother weak point is customization. Actually, the more customization you do, the more you approach to a native solution.\\n\\nIn addition, the more bringing to a native-look you do with your hybrid app, the more expensive it is, so the native solutions become more convenient to use. Otherwise, you will deposit more money and time to your app with the same result.\\n\\n*What Option Is Better?*\\n\\nTo decide which app to build for your business objectives start with considering such factors:\\n- Speed of the app;\\n- What level of user experience you want to have;\\n- How complex your app can be;\\n- Moneywise\\n\\nIt should be quick, responsive, and reliable independently of the option you choose. It is important to reckon with users changing demands because they are getting more advanced in questions connected with mobile apps. \\n\\n**Try to follow such tips:**\\n- Your API infrastructure should be stable and has high accessibility to your content and services;\\n- Consider mobile app as a brand of your company;\\n- Keep in touch with your users, track their normal behaviour while using the app to meet their expectations;\\n- Finally, it will require working with a seasoned team or agency whose speciality lies in UI/UX and development, and are able to offer you the most convenient solution.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n![conclusion-hybrid-mobile-web-app-development---2muchcoffee](/blog/content/images/2018/05/conclusion-hybrid-mobile-web-app-development---2muchcoffee.jpg)\\n\\n[Native apps](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development) surpass others simply because they were created with both technical and UI/UX guidelines. Native apps are also able to get access to the device utilities. So it is usually recommended to build mobile apps in native way because it is best to work with without any sacrifice on some elements that are unique for every platform. However, in case you want to release fast and with less budget app to the market, a web app may be your solution.\\n\\nThe discussion on this topic remains relevant today because the borders between the three approaches are becoming less noticeable. While the discussion to differentiate them keeps on, it’s essential to remember that you should choose a solution not the technology, focus on what you want to do with your app. In case you choose a method that doesn’t provide it then it will require new investments and weeks of waiting when you meet a necessity to add some features.\\n\\nSo, your choice between these approaches should be dependent on a number of issues, including business and app preconditions, developer’s professionalism, and deadline. The essence is that each type of app offers completely unique experience and it is vital to know the pros and cons of each beforehand.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>While studying the development of smartphone apps there is a perennial question always is it better to begin with a web application, hybrid or native app development?</p>\n<p>According to your business purposes and long-run targets, this solution is defined as a step to promotion or deterioration of your business growth.

When\nyou decide to create your app as a website, native, or hybrid mobile app, it's\nimportant to identify all the aspects in this area. Number-one choice will not\nbe declared here, though a comparing of three concepts, representing all the\nstrong and weak points from the company's point of view which are aimed to\nevolve a mobile application will be offered.\n\nWeb Applications\n\n\nWeb apps are stored in browsers. Do they have any distinction of a site? Usually\nsites are packed with material much more than apps due to usability\nprioritization.\n\nNevertheless, web applications do not demand uploading from device stores. They\ncan be reached through internet browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.\nMoreover, your device memory will be safe. We consider web applications just\nlike a technology which breaks down the borders among web, native and hybrid\nmobile applications. Nowadays it’s almost impossible to detect the difference\nbetween web applications hybrid mobile applications or native ones, especially\nwhen it comes to adaptive or responsive design.\n\nAn app uploaded from the app store which is seemed to be a native according to\nall signs, it appears to be a webview as a result ( based on a native language\nagain ) including the URL to a web .The biggest part of the code is performed\nout of a native language. For someone it satisfies their needs, for others it’s\nthe other form of a web application. Hence the conclusion is that web app is a\nwebsite that feels native without the necessity of being downloaded.\n\nHow do you Build a Web App?\nIn general, web applications are built in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5 and\noperated within most common Web browsers. Developers usually work with a custom\npattern instead of using the software development sets. In case you'd like to go\nwith a web app, it will be fast and straight though consider it might have less\nfunctionality comparing to native ones.\n\nProgressive Web Applications [https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development] \nare the mix of web apps and native ones. Despite the shortage of some specific\nfeatures that are common to mobile apps like push messages, offline mode, web\napps made a decent breakthrough toward the latest technologies.\n\nJust appreciate these new capabilities of WPA:\n\n * Push notifications delivering;\n * Swipe gesture and device motion sensor;\n * Ability to reach phone’s hardware.\n\nThough the biggest drawback still exists. Only Google Chrome users can enjoy\ntheir WPA. iOS owners can only patiently wait for such opportunity so far.\n\nPros:\n\n * Simplicity in developing;\n * Simplicity in supporting;\n * Reasonable cost;\n * Same codebase for all platforms as long as they use required technology.\n\nCons:\n\n * It always works through URL, that means always more time to spend to run the\n   app;\n * Lack of speed when it comes to performance;\n * Using the app might be more confusing as they don’t have usual design or\n   functionality;\n * There is no thumbnail on the screen, only bookmark in browser;\n * Inability to use all device capabilities.\n\nNative applications\n\n\nLet's find out what is a native app? The Native applications are the most\npopular kind of applications. Each native application is developed for a\nparticular operating system with a specific demanded language, for example,\nSwift and Objective-C are always for iPhone applications, Java or Kotlin would\nbe for Android, etc. Also, Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will be\nneeded to start developing a native app. Both of the companies monolithes Apple\nand Google give their own widget elements, SDK, and development tools. That's\nthe main reason as well as many other advantages make product owners focus on\nbuilding native apps.\n\nThere are certain pros:\n\n * Native applications work quick and qualitatively cause they were created for\n   a particular system;\n * Usability is always much more than expected;\n * Usually they can be found in devices’ markets;\n * The level of their interactivity is much higher. Moreover they perform much\n   convenient in question of cooperation with user;\n * They provide the access to the full internal features and functions of the\n   platform with no dependence of system’s performance optimizations;\n * Offline mode is supported;\n * It performs much natural for user as it relies on specific UI standards for\n   each system and platform.\n\nAnd cons as well:\n\n * More complicated learning curve, so developers should be qualified enough;\n * More financially consuming;\n * It is not the best solution to build a small app as Native one.\n\nNevertheless web apps aren’t able to get the access to device’s features; mobile\napps have to be periodically updated from the stores to improve their\neffectiveness. In the same time web apps can be updated itself automatically.\nMoreover, native app development makes you able to get direct access to all\nnative frameworks that are not available with other types of development.\n\nDespite the budget may be higher to build a native app, your result will be\nsaving a lot of money and time in a long perspective. Also you can provide your\nusers with a better performance and effectiveness of your app. By all means the\nmix of advantages of native apps leads to a higher level of positive feedbacks\nand users loyalty.\n\nAnother point of view\n\nUsing native, as it was written above, you have to create an app for every\noperating system separately. So that new technologies were released – Xamarin\nand React Native.\n\nXamarin  was developed by Microsoft and it gives a possibility to build one\nprogram on C# which will work on many platforms. It is an open code language, so\nusers may share code with each other and use all the content of C# code\ndatabase.\n\nFacebook - the most popular social networking company nowadays- modeled and\nreleased technology that became in demand very fast. React  gave the ability to\ncover all mobile platforms with the same codebase. It is quite the same feeling\nas you use an app written in Objective-C or Java, but instead it’s build in\nJavaScript and React.\n\nThe term “native” may be explained as a system which is tailored to work on a\nparticular platform. Xamarin or React Native\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/react-development]  technologies are quite crosscutting\nand could be also defined as hybrid. The reason is, for example, that Xamarin\nbuilds native apps for iPhone, Windows and Android apps in C#, and can be\ncreated either in Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio. Moreover, it creates hybrid\nmobile apps for various systems with the same C# codebase,development\nenvironment, language, and Application Programming Interfaces. Nevertheless,\nbecause of an additional level between code and the platform, it’s considered as\nhybrid.\n\nHybrid Apps\n\n\nSuch mobile applications are able to work on different platforms same as native\napps do due to built-in browser environment. A hybrid app pieces together a mix\nof a native and a web features. Customers may install it on their devices,\nnevertheless, it is still actually a web application. These types of apps are\nusually built using HTML, Javascript, CSS, and a Webview is used to run it.\n\nHybrid app development [https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development] \nfunctions comprise the same potential as HTML5. What is more, it also includes\nnative app benefits. Intermediary wrapper gives such an opportunity as\ntranslating instructions into a form that the mobile device understands in order\nto access hardware capabilities of your device.\nA hybrid app comprises the back-end part (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and the\nnative part (which is for downloading and includes the code on Webview).\n\nPros\n\n * It is built with HTML/ CSS/ Javascript to make the process easier;\n * Less expensive than a native app;\n * PhoneGap, Cordova allow run it on multiple platforms;\n * No dependency on specific browser;\n * Device’s storage, internal APIs, camera, etc become reachable;\n * You have a single codebase so it is less time consuming to build.\n\nCons\n\n * Performance is more idle;\n * Third-party service integration to wrap;\n * Cordova apps are behind in interaction;\n * Customization will bring you more to a native model.\n\nCreating hybrid apps, you must deal with such problems as some particular\nfeatures of both native and hybrid systems that make issues much more difficult\nto solve. The performance is a disadvantage as well because of loading in\nwebview. The practice shows that hybrid app is not that user-friendly often as\nit is impossible to customize based on the platform.\n\nAnother weak point is customization. Actually, the more customization you do,\nthe more you approach to a native solution.\n\nIn addition, the more bringing to a native-look you do with your hybrid app, the\nmore expensive it is, so the native solutions become more convenient to use.\nOtherwise, you will deposit more money and time to your app with the same\nresult.\n\nWhat Option Is Better?\n\nTo decide which app to build for your business objectives start with considering\nsuch factors:\n\n * Speed of the app;\n * What level of user experience you want to have;\n * How complex your app can be;\n * Moneywise\n\nIt should be quick, responsive, and reliable independently of the option you\nchoose. It is important to reckon with users changing demands because they are\ngetting more advanced in questions connected with mobile apps.\n\nTry to follow such tips:\n\n * Your API infrastructure should be stable and has high accessibility to your\n   content and services;\n * Consider mobile app as a brand of your company;\n * Keep in touch with your users, track their normal behaviour while using the\n   app to meet their expectations;\n * Finally, it will require working with a seasoned team or agency whose\n   speciality lies in UI/UX and development, and are able to offer you the most\n   convenient solution.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nNative apps [https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development]  surpass others\nsimply because they were created with both technical and UI/UX guidelines.\nNative apps are also able to get access to the device utilities. So it is\nusually recommended to build mobile apps in native way because it is best to\nwork with without any sacrifice on some elements that are unique for every\nplatform.

So all modern companies in case they want to compete for customers have to take this fact into account. That is why they always have to enhance their product in order to supply customers with up-to-dates and easy in use applications. Moreover, they must always find new approaches to reduce resources that are needed to provide all the functionality of their products.\\n\\nOne of the hardest and most important decisions for such companies is to decide what stack of technologies will be used for development of their applications. Once app development appeared, native apps used to dominate over hybrid ones due to some drawbacks in hybrid apps like slow laggish performance or not interactive design. Nevertheless, their reputation was dramatically improved few years ago, when Ionic platform has been published. Nowadays the situation changed and hybrid apps stepped into a new era with an advanced functionality and popularity of multiplatform apps. Below are some points why we need to choose [Ionic mobile app development](https://2muchcoffee.com/ionic-app-development). \\n\\n![cross-platform](/blog/content/images/2018/05/cross-platform.jpg)\\n\\n## Open source that is always costless\\n\\nThere is something like a stereotype connected with open code development. It is said that it is always an immature platform which may break any moment, so that, you would have to waste a lot of time handling different errors. But don’t become disappointed. Just try to work with Ionic and you will see that it is rather fast, stable and safe. Moreover, it can effectively duplicate a native feel.\\n\\nLet’s be honest, application development is rather consuming thing in question of money, time and creativity in all spheres: research and inventing, design and development, marketing and supporting. Your potential framework is able to eat all the resources you had before starting the development and make your wallet really light weight. On the other hand, Ionic is more than simply cheap framework. It may cost you nothing except a salary of your staff. Moreover, you can learn it yourself and work on it accordingly. In that variant Ionic is as simple in learning as making a web page to work in app-shell.\\n\\n## 1) Total madness of developers\\n\\n\\nTry to find someone who is not fond of making an UI which you can design by choosing and combining different elements and do not waste costless time on coding each one separately? Moreover, exactly because you cannot find such a person, Ionic is worth your attention. Its advantage is in possibility of using a list of already written UI elements. So that, different forms, filters, action sheets, menus, bars and other UI part are available for a coder to apply them. In addition, there is the greatest benefit – as developers can concentrate on writing a stable running code instead of wasting time on UI designing. Moreover, as the code is open, it can be reused for anything you need in future. And in the same time you are able to use CSS classes to personalize your UI.\\n\\n## 2) Help and support of community\\n\\n\\nWe all know that it might be hard to start working with a new framework even for professionals. Nevertheless, large and friendly Ionic community will not leave you in trouble alone. Ionic is much sought after by developers as it’s built as an addition to such giants as Cordova or Angular, so do not worry, the community is enormous and always ready to respond.

Nowadays to develop an application with high quality and full of various functions User Interface and use the same code to build an app for both platforms itself is much easier so you can save your time and energy.\\n\\n## 5) Plugins from Cordova\\n\\nDo you know that short parts of a code, usually in Java Script, which is connected to your app and make it performs like a native, are plugins? Ionic users are fond of Cordova plugins that enable access to various possibilities in operating system such as pro-location, access to logs, camera etc. This small pieces of an additional code can improve the performance of your app.\\n\\n## 6) Customization of Interface\\n\\nIonic has started an era of new, convenient and pleasing for user Interface so now nobody will criticize hybrid apps for their eyesore UI. More certain tuning of buttons, colours, and menus and so on, is achieved due to CSS and JavaScript support. So know, we can undoubtedly say that Ionic has truly high level of UI elements standard including Multilanguage adaptation.

It can be scaled to large teams.\\n1. Thanks to its structure your mistakes can hardly cause catastrophic failure.\\n1. There is a rich set of “out of the box” functions.  \\n1. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) lets many devs work on the same application section and use the same data set.\\n1. Detailed documentation which helps your team (but it takes some time for devs to review it).\\n1. The great community provides support and the core team creates new features and new versions of Angular. \\n\\n**Cons of Angular:**\\n1. You need to learn Typescript, what can be rather difficult.\\n1. It’s not as flexible as other frameworks or libraries.\\n1. You have to learn much new concept e.g. module, directive, components, bootstrapping, services, dependency injection etc.\\n1. Angular performs manipulation directly on DOM, while React or Vue do that through virtual DOM.\\n\\n**Comment of our Angular developer:**\\n*Vadim from 2muchcoffee:* As I started with Angular, the choice of front-end frameworks was not big. First I disliked Angular’s difficulty. But now I’m glad to code on this framework. As for me, Vue and React are libraries. And Angular is a real framework with many features and it’s enough for full-fledged [app development](http://https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development).

Its syntax is easy so one can learn it quickly. \\n1. React is much more flexible than Angular: it bundles together many useful concepts.\\n1. It simplifies the work with DOM (using the virtual DOM) because it allows optimizing the eventual number of changes before updating and rendering DOM. It can search, remove and modify elements from the DOM tree quickly.\\n1. React is an open source library that gets many updates from many developers.\\n1. The developers can easily move from the older version to the latest ones.\\n\\n**Cons of React:**\\n1. Sometimes React offers too much choice.\\n1. For saving data you need to use Redux or another library because you can hardly keep data in React itself.\\n1. You won’t find “out of the box” functions and have to bundle additional functions yourself.\\n\\n**Comment of our (2muchcoffee) React developer:**\\n*Alex from 2muchcoffee:* I started web app <u><a href=\\\"https://2muchcoffee.com/react-development\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">development with React</a></u> 2 years ago, and you know, I learned it quickly. Before that, I had tried to learn Angular but this framework had been rather difficult. I like React because it’s flexible and fast. The rendering process is much more quickly. Well, the only thing I don’t like is that I always have to search for additional components. \\n\\n## Advantages and disadvantages of Vue\\n\\n**Pros of Vue:**\\n1. VueJS is easy to learn and work.\\n1. Its documentation is easy to understand.\\n1. Developers almost do not use some extra libraries because this framework already has great built-in functionality.\\n1. If creating SPA (single-page applications) Vue is a good solution. Besides, smaller interactive parts are simply integrated into the existing infrastructure. \\n1. Vue weights not much but works quickly and stays flexible enough. \\n1. It’s also based on DOM same like React is. Nevertheless, it provides more delicate work in question of execution of references to each node of the tree.\\n\\n**Cons of Vue:**\\n1. The community is not very big, although it is quickly growing. The largest part of Vue’s community is from China. That’s why you’ll have to solve appearing issues on your own. \\n1. As for me, job offers are important. And you’ll find a small percentage of Vue job offers.\\n\\n**Comment of a freelance worker coding on Vue:**\\n*Anna:* I like Vue because it took all good things from Angular and React. The docs are really clear and it took me about one day to handle Vue. I found a job as a freelance Vue.js developer and that’s enough for me.

You have to find the right tool for the right\njob. Being a beginning developer you may choose the framework depending on its\nfunctions, difficulty and amount of job offers. Try to work with each framework\nand decide which one fits you.\n\nAnd if you want your project to be developed by experienced developers, \n2muchcoffee mobile application development agency [https://2muchcoffee.com/]  is\nready to discuss and kickoff your project.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/05/react-angular-vuejs.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Angular 2+ vs ReactJS vs Vue.js - which Javascript framework used for web application development is the best","meta_description":"There are 3 most popular frameworks for today.

There you can find answers to questions like how to build client applications or how to create SEO user-friendly interface. Surprisingly, but the most outstanding novelty recently occured on the server side. \\n\\nAnd this is where Angular Universal appears. It is a revolution technology created for developing a totally new generation of Web and [Angular mobile apps](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development). This article is dedicated to highlight its features!\\n\\n## Single Page Application (SPA) Benefits\\n![-Understanding-SEO-2](/blog/content/images/2018/06/-Understanding-SEO-2.jpg)\\n\\nAngular is a framework that sounds familiar to anyone who is close to IT sphere. Same can be said about Single Page Applications.\\nActually, [Angular Single Page Applications](https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development) have a lot of potential benefits and here are some of them:\\n\\n- Smoother and faster UI as most resources HTML + CSS + Scripts are all loaded at once. Later on only that data will be loaded which is necessary for page rendering depends on user’s actions;\\n\\n- SPA works here as a client side technology, HTML page is static while all the dynamic modifications happen in browser.  In earlier PHP, JSP, HTML was blended with server side logic and it was generated on the server. Server had to process more load.\\n\\nNevertheless, we are able to summarize it easily to the fact that Single Page Apps or SPAs supply rather convenient User Interface performance and User Experience as well!\\n\\nTaking into account all stated facts above, you may wonder why SPAs are not used by everyone if it provides such a high-quality user experience. Check below for the usage restraints. \\n\\n## SPA in Angular: Downsides\\n\\nFirstly, it is impossible for a search engine to know certainly whether the web page is ready for processing or it is still in the process of rendering.  For example, search engine can’t get the whole HTML because SPA loading can be still in the process or rendering is not done yet. Only after the MVC is taken into use the page becomes available for search engine to render its data.\\n\\nThe stumbling block is that the engine has to be able to choose the right moment to scan or simply define when rendering is over. Otherwise, there is a huge possibility to index some content which is not ready for a user.\\n\\nFurthermore, the complexity of indexation of SPA deep link is another important reason why SPAs are not so good in collaborating with search engines.\\n\\nSupport absence of HTML5 History in browsers led to a looking for an alternative, such as HTML bookmark anchors (/main#section2) for navigation between URLs. Despite it is hard to index pages separately for a searching engine there is still a set of approaches how to do it. Nevertheless, plain HTML is always a better plan comparing to these approaches.\\n\\nMoreover, the performance question still remains vital for SPA e.g. initial loading is slow. Many agree here that HTML-solution beats out SPA by several points, like speed (especially it concerns mobile phones) as SPA takes longer to start because of processing large JS amounts.\\n\\n## Google enhancements in terms of SPA\\n\\nThe good news for us is that Google improved approach to indexing Single Page Applications. Thus, both reasons mentioned above can not be factually correct anymore. Moreover, the recent official shifting away from using IE9 leads to improving of HTML5 History availability on most platforms. \\n\\nIn its order it makes implementing of URLs anchors not obligatory because simple URLs can be applied , such as /main/section2. \\n\\nOf course, it is a marvelous piece of news. Nevertheless, we should also take into account other search engines that handle an enormous amount of traffic, like Baidu that is popular in China, Yahoo or Bing so loved by Americans.\\n\\nMentioned above doesn’t look appealing for gaining loyal users for sure, though don’t go depressed too early. There is still a way to save the balance between navigation, optimization and performance of SEO for single page apps. It is SEO Angular Universal.\\n\\n## The sense of SEO Angular Universal\\n\\nTo make a long story short, Angular Universal supplies you with opportunity to create SEO-friendly, fast, and interactive sites  with all Single Page Apps benefits.\\n\\n## What is hidden behind ‘server-side rendering’\\n\\nAngular Universal functionality comprises something more than just providing markup rendering on the server side. On the top of just rendering, you will get Angular cut down version to generate required HTML on a side of frontend. As a result, you will get an Angular SEO-friendly Single Page Application with faster launch time due to getting primary HTML payload from the server. \\n\\n## Case when user immediately begins to work  with an Angular SPA page\\n\\nThere is some time in between rendering an initial HTML and taking Angular into effect to run as SPA. Angular Universal now provides a solution to cover the moment when user begins triggering any event before Angular taking over. Such event will be recorded and repeated. Server rendered event is recorded and repeat happens in SPA on the client side.\\n\\n## Easy start with Angular Universal\\n![How-Start-with-Angular](/blog/content/images/2018/06/How-Start-with-Angular.jpg)\\n\\nOne of the best tips is to start with the help of its official universal-starter. It will supply you with application ready for performing that contains express server with  server-side rendering that works off the shelf.\\n\\nAnyway, there are some common issues developer can get faced when dealing with the Angular Universal first project. Despite the fact, ‘it’s all out of the box’ there are still points you need to be aware of. Below a couple of code examples will be cited to demonstrate Angular Universal real cases and make life easier. \\n\\n## Working differently on the client and on the server\\n\\nUsually we expect from our application to perform pretty much the same on both the client and the server side without depending on APIs.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the real life is slightly different. Sometimes there is no opportunity to create such code that will perform the way we have described before. Moreover, we may have a set of actions we want them to act in different ways on the server and the client. \\n\\nFor example, when external libraries that call DOM elements are needed to be used, server side process cannot access browser internal objects, as a result it will cause errors. Let’s consider a case when Svg.js third-party library is in use.

However, @angular/flex-layout starts working only\nonce Angular libraries are fully loaded.\n\nThat should be done to provide a proper operation of mentioned directives.\nDepending on the network performance it can take several second from time passed\nfrom the downloading of initial document till Angular taking over the doc.\n\nDuring this period a user may see the page that doesn’t include flex markup.\nOnce Angular is started all blocks take their correct places but this causes\nflickering.\n\nTo resolve this UX problem we decided to refuse using @angular/flex-layout\ndirectives on the main page, and specified flex markup properties inside CSS\nfile.\n\nSummary\nThe pros of the server-side rendering may expand through the times.\nNevertheless, today it offers a great option for developing SPAs with its mobile\nversions that become Angular SEO-friendly Single Page Applications and are ready\nfor convenient navigation and E-commerce websites with Angular\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/ecommerce-sites-built-with-angular-made-their-way-to-production/]\n.\n\nSo that is why, we may say that now it is simpler to create various kinds of\napplications with Angular Universal and universal-starter to make your\napplications get indexed.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/06/Preview-1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Why Angular Universal is useful for SPA and SEO friendly","meta_description":"Find out how to make Single Page Application (SPA) SEO-friendly with Angular Universal to reach TOP index.

According to this fact, Bootstrap Framework and Angular Material can’t be escaped our attention. Moreover, we are going to make side-by-side review of their features.\\n\\nThe units of Angular may supply you with an opportunity to create rather convenient and embellished user experience while Bootstrap may create an easy to use and neat user interface. Our review may be helpful for those are looking for a comparison, though the matter of taste is still on force. \\nOkay, let’s proceed. \\n\\n## Same Components\\n\\nAt the very beginning we should put our view on components that are the same for both Bootstrap and [Angular Material](https://2muchcoffee.com/angular-web-development). It allows us to decide which one is better for fulfilling your idea.\\n\\n## Button Groups\\n\\nThere is no big difference in realising them. Angular doesn’t have that much variety in button colors, only six of them, like Basic, Accent, Warn, Primary, Link, Disabled. Main focus of Angular Material here is button types and shapes, they are Raise, Basic, Icon, and Fab. Fab and Icon are good for low resolutions, Basic and Raised are typical shapes of buttons used for common apps development. While Bootstrap offer is more freedom in color choice of buttons. You may pick out of the 9 colors set.\\n\\n## Card\\n\\nDespite  the fact that it is hard to write a lot about Cards in terms of [Angular Material and Bootstrap](https://2muchcoffee.com/angular-web-development), I will try to give you as wide image of it as possible. Firstly, these two frameworks offer us quite similar possibilities, so the choice is mostly up to you and your preferences. Nevertheless, you should know that Bootstrap has more various setting options in terms of colors. My point in Cards goes to Bootstrap as it has an unconquerable advantage, such as CSS fixing ability.\\n\\n## Expansion and Collapse features (panel)\\n\\nHere can be said that is the same thing, different names in each framework. Angular Material calls panel Expansion, when Bootstrap has named it Collapse. There is no signature difference that may play a significant role. That’s why, it is again up to you to decide which framework you give a pride place. The only one thing I can draw your attention here while making your choice is Bootstrap Collapse looks quite outdated, CSS can help you out in this case. \\n\\n## Forms tools for inputting\\n\\nForms and Input are the set of tools for form in Angular Material and Bootstrap. Text area, text input, checkbox etc will be required for your forms. Here Angular left behind Bootstrap as it can offer more custom controls, such as Slider, Date Picker, Auto Complete etc. \\n\\n## Choice between Modal and Dialog\\n![Modal_or_Dialog](/blog/content/images/2018/06/Modal_or_Dialog.jpg)\\n\\nThis is again the example of different names for similar functionality component.  . Nevertheless, having tried to play with both it is still a huge dilemma which one is better. The only reason I would give my preference to Angular as it provides you with an opportunity to import a single component, in my case it has been a modal window, though it works the same way with the rest of Angular Material Components.\\n\\n## Menus implementation\\n![Designing_Menu](/blog/content/images/2018/06/Designing_Menu.jpg)\\n\\nThis is the field where our competitors have a little bit distinctive functionality. Angular elements comprises a toolbar which is quite the same with navbar in Bootstrap. Also it  includes an exceptional Angular sidebar with no analogy in Bootstrap.\\nIn the same time, Bootstrap supplies developer with much faster and easier process of a navbar creation comparing to Angular mechanism. Otherwise, in Angular you do not have another choice except working with its Flex Layout in order to create its toolbar that is a quite complicated as for me. \\nAnd the last thing, both our frameworks supply us with the possibility to create a regular or drop-down menu with the help of wide list of components.\\n\\n## Elements for a List \\nAngular has much widely stuffed and easy in exploitation list component set. Bootstrap has rather emptier and complicated in use list of such elements. Nevertheless, Bootstrap as always provide us with more colorful scheme when Angular possibilities in this sphere leaving us with less choice, but you may handle it with the help of some CSS.\\n\\nSome components are \\n•\\tProgress\\n•\\tTooltips\\n•\\tPagination\\n\\n## Bootstrap Unique Components\\n \\nIf you remember we have noticed that there is lot of common and some identical elements which, nevertheless, have different names. However, our frameworks also have some features that make them distinctive. Bootstrap have a set of elements that do not have any equivalents in Angular.  But, we should be aware of the possibility to see these elements in forthcoming Angular releases.\\n\\nThere are such elements you may use in Bootstrap but may not in another our contestant:\\n\\n•\\tAlerts\\n•\\tBreadcrumb\\n•\\tCarousel\\n•\\tCollapse\\n•\\tJumbotron\\n•\\tPopovers\\n•\\tScrollspy\\n\\nNevertheless, Angular has its response to Bootstrap in the set of its components that do not have equivalents in its opponents list of possibilities.\\n\\nYou are able to see such unique Angular Material elements below:\\n\\n•\\tDate picker\\n•\\tSlider\\n•\\tSlide toggle\\n•\\tToolbar\\n•\\tGrid list\\n•\\tStepper\\n•\\tChips\\n•\\tIcon\\n•\\tProgress spinner\\n•\\tSnackbar\\n•\\tSort header\\n\\n## Summary\\n![Summary](/blog/content/images/2018/06/Summary.jpg)\\n\\nAs we can see now, our competitors have many marvelous and useful components available to use. Nevertheless, they have some specific features. For example, Bootstrap has elements that have a huge amount of different add-in tools and helper classes together with a responsive grid design all picked in one. \\nIn the same time, Angular also have such helping tools and, moreover, even more progressive implementation of Material Icons. Nevertheless, it cannot supply responsive web features. When it comes to responsive web design, you’b better make a point of Angular Flex Layout. For better understanding how it works on practice, check [Material design through the case of Angular 6 app with RxJS](https://medium.com/@2muchcoffee/https-medium-com-2muchcoffee-material-design-through-the-case-of-angular-6-app-with-rxjs-ea5e27b6a2de).\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Nowadays the world of programming is picking up speed in adopting new technologies.

And it’s worth knowing that despite the lack of such temps and possibilities as JavaScript in question of integrating the component structure; it still has a few effective things to use in your project. So, in order to give you a helping hand in this tough decision, I have prepared a small review with the touch of a contest. Here are the most popular and maybe the best Angular UI frameworks.\\n\\n## Angular Material (one of the most popular front-end UI frameworks)\\n\\nThis technology is still hold in trust by the [Angular Group web developers](https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development)  and without any doubts they recommend to use it for creating user interface. It includes a large variety of components, that are quite flexible and easy-tuned with an attractive visual effects. \\n\\nWith the constant Angular Group support such library is always keeping up with time and latest updates same as consider all Angular innovations. Though along with this, it does not supply a layout system. For this reason, there is a recommendation to use it in the pair of Angular Flex Layout that also is developed by Angular Group.\\n\\n## Bootstrap\\n\\nActually, we cannot say a lot about a leader of CSS frameworks. It is rather popular and convenient. Bootstrap supply its enormous number of users (it is actually like some add-on for searching some pieces of advice among them) with a wide set of various components.\\n\\nIf you make a search request on Github you may find a list of two great projects that are supporting Bootstrap. The first is the Valor-Softwares' project called ngx-bootstrap. Made totally with the use of Bootstrap 4 technology. It is a library that supplies developers with various kinds of widgets. Second is the library called ng-bootstrap which is being made by the team with the same name. \\n\\nDespite these teams both are good enough, the first one has a practice experience, because these guys are bearing the blame of UI Bootstrap library which takes the first place in ratings list of Bootstrap connected with AngularJS.\\n\\n## PrimeNG\\n![PrimeNG](/blog/content/images/2018/06/PrimeNG.jpg)\\n\\n Actually, it is a representative of worldwide popular technology PrimeFaces UI that appertains without any doubts to the set of the most progressive systems for Java. PrimeNG supplies a lot of effective and helpful elements for you as a developer who is going to create a great User Interface. By all means, in case you choose it for your project you get a mature and fully-packed technology. Moreover, it is always in process of enhancing and re-development in order to handle all possible issues. \\n \\n Rather plain themes setting is its Achilles heel because of putting emphasis on the attractiveness. You have to buy some tools like Material Design Guidelines. Nevertheless, you may find some free options, but they undoubtedly will have fewer opportunities to work with. And the last thing, they have always a problem with its documentations that are not in total accordance with the certain release. But, fortunately, they are always trying to handle this situation.\\n \\n## Covalent UI\\n![Covalent_UI](/blog/content/images/2018/06/Covalent_UI.jpg)\\n\\nData management company Teradata has established UI project in order to use it in achieving their own goals. Nevertheless, they made it available for all others who want to employ it too by providing open source and framework for publicity. This technology ensue the principles of Material Design. It leads to the opportunity for us to employ lot of rather useful layouts which can be used in order to increase the speed of the creation of your project. \\n\\nBesides, Covalent UI has an enormous set of elements and probably the most mature document support compared with the others.\\n\\n In fact, it is also available for Electron variety of commands. It means that in case you are operating with such type of apps you are able to derive a lot of vantages from it. In case Teradata continue encouraging Covalent UI and keep the current level of dedicating to its power and resources, this technology may even become one of the best in history!\\n \\n## Clarity\\n![Clarity](/blog/content/images/2018/06/Clarity.jpg)\\n\\nThe Last but not the least member of our list is Clarity. It was put forward as a mature UX determination that may even replace plain Angular CSS frameworks in perspective. Developed by the VMware group it was planned to use it only for striving for their own goals and ideas. Nevertheless, after a while they changed their original intention and made Clarity open source and available for publicity access.\\n\\nAt the very beginning it was contemplated as more progressive thing than UI framework because they intended to supply the rich and modernized UX guideline and compound it with famous JS frameworks with developing suitable libraries. Actually this project was something like a response to Material Guideline developed by Google. Nevertheless, they also intend to supply some extra elements for such kind of guidelines. \\n \\nToday they have realized some of their ideas, while others are still waiting for their moments. Although, today they are developing only Angular CSS Framework, they still are planning to work with React and realize another their project too.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAll mentioned above libraries own a quite good set of ready-to-go solutions for User Interface. Angular Material should be differentiated here between others as the most advanced and supported by Angular core team project. This library has multiple components for different visual UI features implementing  due to fundamental rules  of material design.\\n\\nBootstrap couldn’t avoid our attention either. This is the library with one of the biggest amount of users and followers, so that it may be counted as a great benefit in our contest. Nevertheless, you should have a general knowledge of its multiteams developments.  \\n\\nAnyway, any of the named above options will make your development process easier and faster in times. The library choice  always depends on a specific project’s needs and goals.  \\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>I have made a decision recently to use some CSS framework while I was developing an application using <a href=\"https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/angular-6-features/\">Angular 6</a>.

And it’s worth knowing that\ndespite the lack of such temps and possibilities as JavaScript in question of\nintegrating the component structure; it still has a few effective things to use\nin your project. So, in order to give you a helping hand in this tough decision,\nI have prepared a small review with the touch of a contest. Here are the most\npopular and maybe the best Angular UI frameworks.\n\nAngular Material (one of the most popular front-end UI frameworks)\nThis technology is still hold in trust by the Angular Group web developers\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development]  and without any doubts they recommend\nto use it for creating user interface. It includes a large variety of\ncomponents, that are quite flexible and easy-tuned with an attractive visual\neffects.\n\nWith the constant Angular Group support such library is always keeping up with\ntime and latest updates same as consider all Angular innovations. Though along\nwith this, it does not supply a layout system. For this reason, there is a\nrecommendation to use it in the pair of Angular Flex Layout that also is\ndeveloped by Angular Group.\n\nBootstrap\nActually, we cannot say a lot about a leader of CSS frameworks. It is rather\npopular and convenient. Bootstrap supply its enormous number of users (it is\nactually like some add-on for searching some pieces of advice among them) with a\nwide set of various components.\n\nIf you make a search request on Github you may find a list of two great projects\nthat are supporting Bootstrap. The first is the Valor-Softwares' project called\nngx-bootstrap. Made totally with the use of Bootstrap 4 technology. It is a\nlibrary that supplies developers with various kinds of widgets. Second is the\nlibrary called ng-bootstrap which is being made by the team with the same name.\n\nDespite these teams both are good enough, the first one has a practice\nexperience, because these guys are bearing the blame of UI Bootstrap library\nwhich takes the first place in ratings list of Bootstrap connected with\nAngularJS.\n\nPrimeNG\n\n\nActually, it is a representative of worldwide popular technology PrimeFaces UI\nthat appertains without any doubts to the set of the most progressive systems\nfor Java. PrimeNG supplies a lot of effective and helpful elements for you as a\ndeveloper who is going to create a great User Interface. By all means, in case\nyou choose it for your project you get a mature and fully-packed technology.\nMoreover, it is always in process of enhancing and re-development in order to\nhandle all possible issues.\n\nRather plain themes setting is its Achilles heel because of putting emphasis on\nthe attractiveness.

And the last thing, they have always a problem\nwith its documentations that are not in total accordance with the certain\nrelease. But, fortunately, they are always trying to handle this situation.\n\nCovalent UI\n\n\nData management company Teradata has established UI project in order to use it\nin achieving their own goals. Nevertheless, they made it available for all\nothers who want to employ it too by providing open source and framework for\npublicity. This technology ensue the principles of Material Design.

In case Teradata continue encouraging Covalent UI and keep the\ncurrent level of dedicating to its power and resources, this technology may even\nbecome one of the best in history!\n\nClarity\n\n\nThe Last but not the least member of our list is Clarity. It was put forward as\na mature UX determination that may even replace plain Angular CSS frameworks in\nperspective. Developed by the VMware group it was planned to use it only for\nstriving for their own goals and ideas.

Developers often use Apache Cordova and similar to create [hybrid mobile apps](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development) (our case is about angular mobile apps), which give an opportunity to access native device capabilities i.e. camera, geolocation, accelerometer and others. But these type of applications don’t provide the same level of \\nusability as native ones because they utilize WebView instead of smartphones native UI.\\n\\nNativeScript is an open source framework that allows to develop mobile apps with platform-native UI without WebViews on [Angular 6](https://2muchcoffee.com/angular-web-development) , TypeScript/Javascript. NativeScript is a perfect choice for Angular experienced front end developers as it can appreciably decrease development time of native iOS and Android applications without adversely affecting UX development.\\n\\n\\nFor application design NativeScript uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). So basic knowledge of existing web standards will be enough to change the appearance of application views and elements. See the simple example of an orange that was styled to spin:\\n\\n    <Image src=\\\"~/img/orange.jpg\\\"></Image>\\n    \\n    @keyframes spin {\\n      from { transform: rotate(0); }\\n      to { transform: rotate(360); }\\n    }\\n    Image {\\n      animation-name: spin;\\n      animation-duration: 4s;\\n      animation-iteration-count: infinite;\\n      animation-timing-function: linear;\\n    }\\n\\nThe NativeScript approach provides multiple benefits.\\n\\n## Use your front end skills\\n\\nNative mobile apps for iOS and Android require developers to know different languages. For Android that is Java, Kotlin, C#.. while for iOS that is Swift or Objective-C. NativeScript uses only one - Javascript.\\n\\nJavascript is popular, flexible, and widespread language. For typescript admirers there is a first-class support for TypeScript directly from NativeScript CLI. Moreover, NativeScript uses standard web tools for developing app: CSS for appearance, NPM for package management, Webpack for building.\\n\\nAnd of course special mention should be made of NativeScript integration with Angular. The possibility to use only one framework for both web and native apps is a significant advantage. This can allow to share codebase for each of them. \\n\\n## Mobile app works natively on iOS and Android\\n\\nDevelopers can write a single code on NativeScript for native iOS and Android applications. Thereby plenty of time can be saved on creating and maintaining your app for each mobile platform. \\n\\nNativeScript renders the code written on Javascript and CSS into native UI of mobile OS. Case in point is NativeScript component *ActionBar*:\\n    \\n    <ActionBar title=\\\"NativeScript ActionBar\\\"></ActionBar>\\n    \\nIt is compiled to *android.support.v7.app.ActionBar* for Android and *UINavigationBar* for iOS. So this component becomes the corresponding native UI app element:\\n\\n![Angular-mobile-app](/blog/content/images/2018/07/Angular-mobile-app.jpg)\\n\\nSuch functionality can be quite easily written in native iOS and Android code but supporting separate apps can take up too much time and money. Especially if each codebase is maintained by different developers. That is why NativeScript suits well for applications that have to work on both Android and iOS platforms.\\n\\n## Native performance\\n\\nThere are a lot of different frameworks, such as Apache Cordova, that give an opportunity to build iOS and Android apps from a shared codebase. But in comparison with them NativeScript boasts of its user interface.\\n\\nWhilst Cordova based approaches work with WebView to translate app appearance in HTML, NativeScript renders fully native Android and iOS UI components. So developers can create compelling user interfaces as NativeScript allows to manipulate the DOM on app pages. It is the best solution for applications requiring high efficiency that provide native UI components.\\n\\n## Native Android or iOS APIs usage\\n\\n![Native-Android-or-iOS-APIs-usage](/blog/content/images/2018/07/Native-Android-or-iOS-APIs-usage.jpg)\\n\\nEnterprise applications might require an ability to handle native Android or iOS APIs. NativeScript has some out of the box features for developers to access those APIs, e.g. typing *java.lang.Math.min* or *UIAlert* in Javascript or TypeScript makes native APIs easily run. \\n\\nUsing native mobile APIs might dismay some developers. Fortunately, they can find a bunch of NativeScript plugins that simplify sophisticated native actions to easy-to-handle APIs.\\n\\nAlthough other cross-platform mobile frameworks have sufficient plugins as well, NativeScript plugins allow to do more, like accessing native frameworks such as CocoaPods and giving developers the ability to create native UI plugins. It ought to be noted that [NativeScript Plugins Repository](https://market.nativescript.org/) is already contains a lot of plugins for common developers needs. Those are free and open source as NativeScript itself.\\n\\n## Strong support\\n\\nUsually enterprises prefer a framework with the company creator support. Thus nullifying the risk of framework dropping out before project release. NativeScript is supported by [Progress](https://www.progress.com/), global public traded software company that suggests different enterprise support agreements for a deeper level of support.\\n\\nAlso, Progress actively develops NativeScript tools that give an opportunity for companies whose apps are written on Javascript to expand standards of business apps developing for the series of use cases simultaneously creating top-class UX without WebView performance problems. There is no need to check if your mobile app has native efficiency. Native performance is behind the NativeScript framework.\\n\\nThe NativeScript architecture provides deep integration with widespread front end frameworks like Angular or Vue. Creating NativeScript mobile app via Angular allows developers to use such features as integration with Angular CLI, code generator, router support etc.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n![conclusion](/blog/content/images/2018/07/conclusion.jpg)\\n\\nNativeScript is an impressive open source framework for building native mobile applications. It is an excellent solution for developing a truly cross-platform app with a single codebase for iOS and Android so the application uses the same APIs as if it’s written in Xcode or Android Studio. \\n\\nNativeScript directly supports Angular framework.

And our goal is clear and honest analyst. There are actually two controversial points of view on whether we should rely on a NON-Disclosure Agreement while c[reating an mobile application](hhttps://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development) or it may be rather destructive for our project.\\n\\nNevertheless, at the very beginning we have to find out the essence and notion of the NDA and only after that we are able to try to decide on the necessity of it for our development.\\n\\n\\nThat is why, in this short article we want to offer you some facts and ideas that were taken from our experience in order to make you familiar with the NDA and this way help you with the decision mentioned earlier.\\n\\n## I Non-Disclosure Agreement for a Mobile App: FAQ\\n![I-Non-Disclosure-Agreement-for-a-Mobile-App--FAQ](/blog/content/images/2018/07/I-Non-Disclosure-Agreement-for-a-Mobile-App--FAQ.jpg)\\nThe first part we offer you to become acquainted with the most popular issues under discussion related with our topic.\\n\\n### First Issue: The notion of NON-disclosure Agreement?\\n\\nAs you have understood, the NDA is a shortcut of NON-disclosure Agreement. In fact, it is available for anything which requires the care of its intellectual estate and copyrights.\\n\\n**So it is cleare that its priority and the only goal is taking care of your intellectual rights: ideas, secret tricks of profession and other private stuff, in order to prevent the leakage that may harm your business.**\\n\\n### Second Issue: Which counteragent should I choose in order to ratify the NON-disclosure Agreement?\\n\\nActually, the number of the candidates is quite huge. If understand widely, it is better for you to ratify the agreement with all who  may be familiar with any kind of your private information while the process of your project creation.\\n\\nNevertheless, to be clear, the priority of ratifying the agreement should be given at first turn to:\\n\\n**The members of your group.** In case it’s [team development](https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development), especially enterprises it is almost obligatory to ratify it with them. Such decision is like an empirical guideline because the NDA may save your idea by reducing a possibility of leakage and sharing your thoughts and ideas among those who are not working on them.\\n\\n**Employed programmers.** In our opinion this category without any doubts simply must ratify the agreement with you. Moreover, keep it in mind that this agreement should protect some of your projects' secrets even after finishing it.\\n\\n**Examination team.** As soon as QA engineer gets an admission to your project, its specific features and innovative ideas, you should be aware of them as about the source of certain risk and ratify the NDA.\\n\\n**All other members of your development group including [web and mobile designers](https://2muchcoffee.com/design) and so on.** It is the same situation as with previous group. It is obligatory to ratify the Non-disclosure agreement with them directly after they became familiar with the essence of your project.\\n\\n### Third issue: When it is better to ratify the Non-disclosure agreement?\\n\\nThere is no certain recommendation on what period to choose in order to ratify the NDA with their development team.\\n\\n**So, remember!** *The really convenient moment is a few seconds when you just employ a team or a single developer, just after signing an offer with your new worker.*\\n\\nNevertheless, you may use another option, to ratify the agreement with an employee while interviewing him in case of some specific features of your project will be highlighted.\\n\\n### Fourth issue: Does some unified pattern exist?\\n\\nActually, despite it is possible to create a pattern of mobile apps Non-disclosure agreement, it wasn’t created so you may formulate it by yourself.\\n\\n In most cases, different development organizations prepare their own patterns in accordance with their demands. In case some company really worries about its recommendation, credentials and professional fame, it may not prepare some booby traps in the pattern of the NDA they offer.\\n \\nNevertheless, you are able to, moreover, you must check it and suggest your ideas and remarks or the whole pattern.\\n\\nIn case you are a bit lazy, it is possible to use someone’s pattern as an example or even for ratifying. For example, you may use a pattern prepared by Stormotion.\\n\\n### Fifth issue: What structure parts are obligatory to use in the pattern of your Non-disclosure agreement?\\n\\nAccording to the lack of unified pattern of the Non-disclosure agreement, you have to be rather attentive while ratifying. There is no place for mistakes, so try to consider all necessary elements as more precisely as possible.\\n\\nFor that reason, below are some necessary information for you that might be useful while working on NDA. \\n\\n**Specification with the secret information.** When you prepare your pattern of the NDA you have to highlight the certain list of information, secret features that should be kept private.\\n\\n**Parties.** You should define the possibility of different groups of your employees to share protected information, if so who is available to do it and under what circumstances. Especially you should do this for organization of the data sharing inside your team, between different groups of co-workers. A good illustration is the necessity for developers to share some technical specifications with QA Engineers.\\n\\n**Timeframes.** You also have to set the period of time  while this agreement will be valid. Nevertheless, you should assign the workable one, usually no longer than 5-6 years but can be less.\\n\\n**Forbidden usage of your private information.** At this stage the allowance and forbiddance of confidential information usage should be determined.\\n*Remember*, there can be a situation when such information may be requested by some governmental organization so, it must be revealed for them. In such case your signers can not take responsibility for disclosure as it was on legal background.\\n![Forbidden-usage-of-your-private-information](/blog/content/images/2018/07/Forbidden-usage-of-your-private-information.jpg)\\n**Competence sphere of authority.** It’s also be a good idea to specify what court your petition will be addressed in case your Non-disclosure agreement is breached.\\n\\n**Legal remedies.** Here you should specify what fines may be taken in case someone of your signers decide to disclose your private information as well as possible solutions for handling the  this situation.\\n\\n**Furthermore**, try to keep in mind and specify who will take responsibility for some payments in case some litigation will be registered.\\nTermination. And the last but not the least is the part where it is important to specify the ability to terminate the contract at any moment except the situation when it may violate the paragraphs of your contract or law.\\n\\n\\n**A piece of advice:** *try to avoid some huge amounts for fines like 100,000 euros for the abusing your Non-disclosure agreement for your mobile app development team. The most convenient decision is to declare that in such cases the amount of contribution will be decided based on law statements.*\\n\\nThere were a few clauses of your potential pattern of Non-disclosure agreement for your team of developers. Try to keep them in mind for your future NDA pattern.\\n\\nHope now we have given all the required answers on your possible questions and now you are familiar enough with the NDA, so we may continue.\\n\\n## 5 most important 'why?' you should ratify the NDA for your application project.\\n![5-most-important--why---you-should-ratify-the-NDA-for-your-application-project.-](/blog/content/images/2018/07/5-most-important--why---you-should-ratify-the-NDA-for-your-application-project.-.jpg)\\n### First cause: The protection of your confidentiality\\n\\nSuch sort of data is vital for surviving and protection of your practice and providing potential success of your idea.

The main purpose is to assess the situation\nincluding performance aspect, engineer and technological aspects and present\nsome strategies that may renew your platform.\n\nBasic  is dedicated to creation an entirely new application which requires total\nmarket investigation and technological prospect. It starts beforehand and\ncomprises market survey, researching all the consumers demands and needs, all\nspecific features that might be required, user stories, wireframes, functional\nand technological solutions which add extensibility to your product.\n\n- Process structuring of app building.\nProcess structuring of app creation has rather high impact on efficiency and the\namount of time and efforts that can be spent on it. In case you are a novice we\nrecommend to hire an organization with agile methodology approach to managing.\nIt means that the organization can launch your marketplace using the minimal of\nrequired functionality and, moreover, prepare it to forthcoming upgrades.\n\n- Organization culture.\n- The way the team communicates with the client.\nLeft all the doubts behind and ask about the way they are going to organize\ncommunication flow. Try to discover the frequency they do contact, whether an\norganization use Skype or other messengers on a daily basis, who is in charge of\nit and the way they solve some extraordinary situations.\n\n- Traditions and restrictions of an organization.\nIn case you are eager to know all the deep secrets and be rather familiar with\nthe organization, wonder about traditions and restrictions and so on. Doing that\nyou can find out more interesting information about the life of an organization,\nthe way it delights consumers and workers.\n\nDon’t be afraid to spend your time on learning and comparing a set of various\norganizations. It is not a secret that the success and prosperity of your online\nmarketplace strictly tied with the team that is working on it. For that reason,\nyou shouldn’t hesitate about spending your efforts on searching the right\norganization.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/07/preview-2muchcoffee-Outsourcing-Company.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Your Choice of Outsourcing organization in order to develop your own marketplace application","meta_description":"Use some great tips you can find in the article and pick the best way to choose IT consulting service for your marketplace application","author_id":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","created_at":"2018-07-11T12:41:35.000Z","created_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","updated_at":"2019-01-22T10:35:59.000Z","updated_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","published_at":"2018-07-12T07:41:19.000Z","published_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","custom_excerpt":"If you want to get BEST CTO services for marketplace app, this tutorial is for you.

This is the developers’ routine.  Every time we study something new to come up with the right solution or overcome some blockers, or improve skills. I think it happened to every developer who started learning something new. Having started working on the latest project, our team decided to choose Angular 6 as the best solution. \\n\\nThis article is based on search queries that often led us to AngularJS, which is the predecessor of Angular. Actually, the recent  Angular is radically different from AngularJS, it's a newer framework that has a lot of functionality and is easier to learn. Currently, the actual Angular version is 6. In this article I will briefly describe how to build your first Angular app, connecting popular **Sass libraries**, **Font Awesome**, and **NG-Bootstrap**.\\n\\nThe article is aimed at developers who are eager to convert to Angular and make it in a perfect way. Remember the basic commands for creating and configuring the application and understanding how to connect different libraries.\\n\\n\\n## Stage 1: Visual Studio Code Usage\\n![visual-studio-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/visual-studio-1.png)\\n\\nThere are many IDEs that you can use for our task. The article app is based on  Visual Studio Code, this choice for me is more preferable. You can use whatever you like though. In VS Code there are many extensions. One of my favorite is \\\"**Debugger for Chrome**\\\". It allows me to debug JavaScript directly in the editor. It also supports automatic saving, which means that you do not need to save your changes to files each time, the editor will do it for you. This is a small part of what this editor can do. Working in this editor has really become convenient for me as it helps to identify errors even while writing the code, knowing the hotkeys development becomes much faster and more productive.\\n\\n## Stage 2: Add Angular CLI\\n![angular-cli-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/angular-cli-1.png)\\nAngular CLI is a great tool to create and work with Angular. It does not have to be used, but I would recommend it.  **Angular CLI** allows you to write clean code using the best practices described in the Angular documentation. For more detailed information read its official documentation, or official Angular website. \\n\\nNow let's look how to install and use all Angular CLI advantages. As your primary step you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your computer. After installing **node.js**,  write a command:\\n\\n    npm i -g @angular/cli\\n\\nAfter that we will go with \\\"*ng new*\\\".  You can read more about it here https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/new.\\nLet's write in the terminal another one:\\n\\n    ng new myFirstApp --style sass\\n    \\nThis will install the myFirstApp folder in which our application will be located. Pay attention to the flag \\\"*--style sass*\\\", it indicates that our application will use Sass. Now we can open this folder with our IDE. In order to run our application use  \\\"*ng serve*”.\\n\\nVS Code has its own terminal, so I can right there and write a command:   \\n    \\n    ng serve --o\\n\\n\\nThe \\\"*--o*\\\" flag indicates that our application will automatically open in the browser.\\n\\nWe should see in the terminal how our application is built. Then browser will automatically open the main page of our application.\\n\\n## Stage 3: Add RxJs\\n![rxjs-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/rxjs-1.png)\\nRxJs is a powerful library that allows you to perform any operations on data. Imagine that you need to process data with several functions that are called one after another and perform different manipulations with your data. Here one of the functions has an error that you need to intercept. When it occurs you need to send to a user an error number. With the help of RxJS it will be very simple. This library provides a lot of so-called \\\"operators\\\" that are called one after another and allow you to perform any operations on your data.\\n\\nHowever, learning its capabilities might take some time, but it is worth your efforts. Of course, using this library it’s not mandatory, but if you understand how it works in your hands will be a powerful tool for processing data and tracking every event that emits your application. Using RxJs also prevents repeating the parts with the same code, and helps to reduce your multi-line code by dividing it in a couple of lines. In the documentation of the library, you can find a detailed description of each operator with illustrations. For more information on the library, please see the link: https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com.\\n\\n## Some extra: Typescript and Webpack\\n![typescript-webpack-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/typescript-webpack-1.png)\\nThe developers of Angular have their own opinion about the building process and this is perfectly reflected in performance. Now the developers do not need to worry about the build process as with Gulp or Grant libraries.\\n\\nAngular uses TypeScript under the hood, so if you look at our application, you can see that the files created by Angular CLI have the extension \\\"**.ts**\\\". TypeScript allows us to use static typing, which simplifies development. Therefore, when building our application, our TypeScript code is converted to pure JavaScript for the browsers.\\n\\nWhat are the advantages of using TypeScript (TS)? Let's look at the main ones in order to understand why it’s used by Angular:\\n\\n1.TS is the only language that is clearly compiled into JavaScript, so Angular components become more readable and structured.\\n\\n2.TS is a superset over JavaScript, so regular JS can be used in components, and this will not disrupt the application.\\n\\n3.A good and readable code is competently defined interfaces and classes, and since pure JS does not support interfaces, TS is an ideal development option.\\n \\n4.Strict typing, which allows you to define clear types of variables and arguments that a function will take, this avoids the problems that can arise in a large application and confuse you. Since the editor itself will prompt you what kind of data should be in a particular variable.\\n\\n5.Presence of private, protected and readonly properties, now we can specify properties that can not be overridden.\\n\\nTherefore, I think the use of TS will appeal many C# developers. Using TS Angular gives more features and simplifies development.\\n\\n\\nWe need a build process for one more reason, it concludes that we use Sass. During the build process, our Sass code is compiled into CSS.\\n\\nAngular uses the WebPack library, if you look at our application, you can find a file called \\\"**angular.json**\\\" which allows us to customize the build process if necessary. But you rarely need to change something there.\\n\\n## Stage 4:  Bootstrap 4 in a project\\n![bootstrap-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/bootstrap-1.png)\\nThe easiest way to connect the bootstrap library with NPM is using terminal and writing a command:\\n\\n    npm i bootstrap --save\\n\\nThis will load the library into the node_modules folder, also, note the \\\"*--save*\\\" flag, it will add a dependency to the **package.json** file.\\nIn the same way, we can load Font-awesome. To do so below is your next step:\\n\\n    npm i font-awesome --save\\n\\nNow to begin working with our libraries, we need to add their Sass files into our styles. To do this, find in our application a file called \\\"**style.sass**\\\".\\n Add there such imports:\\n\\n    @import \\\"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\\\";\\n\\n    $fa-font-path : '../node_modules/font-awesome/fonts';\\n\\n    @import '../node_modules/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome';\\n\\nThis is all that is necessary for our application so we can take advantage of bootstrap and Font-awesome libraries.\\n\\n## Stage 5: NG Bootstrap\\n![ng-bootstrap-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/ng-bootstrap-1.png)\\n\\nMultiple bootstrap components need a reference to the JavaScript file. Therefore, Angular has an excellent NG Bootstrap library that provides us with bootstrap 4 components running from Angular.\\n\\nInstall it easily using **NPM**, for this we introduce one more command:\\n\\n    npm i @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap --save\\n\\nWhen the installation succeeds we will need to import the library module into our **app.module.ts**.To do this, go to our app in the app folder and find our module there, insert the import of the **NgbModule**:\\n\\n    import { NgbModule } from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';\\n\\nSo the **AppModule** should look like:\\n\\n    @NgModule({\\n     declarations: [\\n       AppComponent,\\n     ],\\n     imports: [\\n       BrowserModule,\\n       NgbModule.forRoot()\\n     ],\\n     bootstrap: [AppComponent]\\n    })\\n    export class AppModule { }\\n\\n\\nThis is basically all you need to use **NG Bootstrap**. Now we can use the components of this library in our templates and components.\\nThere is an excellent documentation that describes in details how to use this library https://ng-bootstrap.github.io.\\n\\n## Be Efficient\\n![be-effecient-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/be-effecient-1.png)\\nI'm a developer who almost always writes in C #, ASP.NET MVC and a lot of jQuery. In my opinion the combination of Angular and TypeScript has made JavaScript easier to learn as it looks more familiar now to the rest of developers. I was amazed at how structured and clean my code was, it was truly an evolutionary step in my experience.\\nAfter studying Angular, I realized that all the questions that I had, I could easily find in the official documentation, so I recommend that before switching to StackOverflow.\\n\\n\\nLet's sum up the difference between AngularJS and Angular? The biggest plus is the learning curve in Angular is much lower than in AngularJS, many opportunities are provided to you right out of the box. With Angular CLI you no longer need to engage in long setup of the application, many console commands that simplify the life of the developer. You can create a clean and structured code easily, you can do most of the tasks very simply. When you learn to understand what \\\"**Components and Services**\\\" is, you can be very efficient. All I need in my work is to sit down and code, instead of being engaged in unnecessary tasks They simply took my time away.

Using TS\nAngular gives more features and simplifies development.\n\nWe need a build process for one more reason, it concludes that we use Sass.\nDuring the build process, our Sass code is compiled into CSS.\n\nAngular uses the WebPack library, if you look at our application, you can find a\nfile called \"angular.json\" which allows us to customize the build process if\nnecessary. But you rarely need to change something there.\n\nStage 4: Bootstrap 4 in a project\n\nThe easiest way to connect the bootstrap library with NPM is using terminal and\nwriting a command:\n\nnpm i bootstrap --save\n\n\nThis will load the library into the node_modules folder, also, note the \"--save\"\nflag, it will add a dependency to the package.json  file.\nIn the same way, we can load Font-awesome. To do so below is your next step:\n\nnpm i font-awesome --save\n\n\nNow to begin working with our libraries, we need to add their Sass files into\nour styles. To do this, find in our application a file called \"style.sass\".\nAdd there such imports:\n\n@import \"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\n\n$fa-font-path : '../node_modules/font-awesome/fonts';\n\n@import '../node_modules/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome';\n\n\nThis is all that is necessary for our application so we can take advantage of\nbootstrap and Font-awesome libraries.\n\nStage 5: NG Bootstrap\n\n\nMultiple bootstrap components need a reference to the JavaScript file.\nTherefore, Angular has an excellent NG Bootstrap library that provides us with\nbootstrap 4 components running from Angular.\n\nInstall it easily using NPM, for this we introduce one more command:\n\nnpm i @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap --save\n\n\nWhen the installation succeeds we will need to import the library module into\nour app.module.ts.To do this, go to our app in the app folder and find our\nmodule there, insert the import of the NgbModule:\n\nimport { NgbModule } from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';\n\n\nSo the AppModule  should look like:\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [\n   AppComponent,\n ],\n imports: [\n   BrowserModule,\n   NgbModule.forRoot()\n ],\n bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n\nThis is basically all you need to use NG Bootstrap. Now we can use the\ncomponents of this library in our templates and components.\nThere is an excellent documentation that describes in details how to use this\nlibrary https://ng-bootstrap.github.io.\n\nBe Efficient\n\nI'm a developer who almost always writes in C #, ASP.NET MVC and a lot of\njQuery. In my opinion the combination of Angular and TypeScript has made\nJavaScript easier to learn as it looks more familiar now to the rest of\ndevelopers. I was amazed at how structured and clean my code was, it was truly\nan evolutionary step in my experience.\nAfter studying Angular, I realized that all the questions that I had, I could\neasily find in the official documentation, so I recommend that before switching\nto StackOverflow.\n\nLet's sum up the difference between AngularJS and Angular? The biggest plus is\nthe learning curve in Angular is much lower than in AngularJS, many\nopportunities are provided to you right out of the box. With Angular CLI you no\nlonger need to engage in long setup of the application, many console commands\nthat simplify the life of the developer. You can create a clean and structured\ncode easily, you can do most of the tasks very simply. When you learn to\nunderstand what \"Components and Services\" is, you can be very efficient. All I\nneed in my work is to sit down and code, instead of being engaged in unnecessary\ntasks They simply took my time away. Not anymore with Angular 6.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/07/preview-2.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Angular 6 Project with Ng-Bootstrap and SASS","meta_description":"If you want to succeed with Angular 6 project, you should definitely use ng-bootstrap and SASS.

Let’s do the same with the development company.\\n\\n## Advantages of Employing a development organization\\n![advantages-company](/blog/content/images/2018/07/advantages-company.png)\\nBefore starting you should remember that it is rather difficult for a single developer to cover all the amount of work. It is clear that organizations have a wider set of possibilities in order to cover your demands and prepare more than one developer can do. Moreover, an organization is able to supply you not only with developing options but also with further maintaining of your project and its enhancement too. For this reason, let’s look at the main pluses and minuses of employing a development organization\\n\\n### Teamwork.\\nIn case cooperating with a company, you will get access to the capabilities of an entire team of professional programmers. As a result, a lot of various and efficient specialist in different spheres will be engaged in your project.\\n\\n### Technological back-end.\\nIt is clear that in case you do not have a clear codebase created in accordance with certain standards your application won’t be able to perform on different platforms with the same level of effectiveness. That is why the backend should be created due to your applications’ demands, which will ensure high-quality of your application on various devices.\\n\\n### Constant maintenance.\\nThe really great advantage is that any development organization will not stop maintaining your project just after its launch. Instead, its staff will be always available in order to give a helping hand. In the same time, a freelance programmer won’t be simply able to supply your project with further maintenance because he/she doesn’t have enough tools and possibilities for such purpose.\\n\\n### High-quality product.\\nIt is impossible to find a website nominated for an award that is created by a single developer. In case you see some website full of elegance, swiftness, smoothness, it can be guaranteed that it was created by an efficient team of developers and other specialists. That is why, in case you are looking for something more than just simple realization, try to avoid single freelancers.\\n\\n## Cons of employing a development company\\n![disadvantages-company-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/disadvantages-company-1.png)\\nDespite all the advantages, such an approach also has its cons and we consider ourselves obliged to highlight them as well.\\n\\n### Much higher financial requirements.\\nIt is necessary to repeat that hiring an entire organization is rather expensive and demands a wider budget than cooperating with a freelance developer. Moreover, an organization also includes some other expenses as office-rent, taxes and so on.\\n\\n### Extended development time.\\nBecause of the approaches the companies use in the workflow, they need more time to finish projects. That doesn’t mean they work slowly.  The reason is the overhead in the communication process and inner cooperation. In order to prepare a better-quality result than a single developer, an organization will need at least a few times longer period than a single developer.\\n\\n### Possible Miscommunication.\\nIn most cases, if you employ an organization you will definitely cooperate with one responsible manager and he/she in his/her turn will organize the whole workflow. As the result, your project will be developed by the people you may never see. For this reason, the possibility of a misunderstanding between your thoughts and what developers understand is increased. One of the possible solution to avoid that is to create specifications and instructions for the developers beforehand. Nevertheless, the chance of misunderstanding will be still high.\\n\\n## Development company versus a single developer\\n\\nWe have got acquainted with the list of the main advantages and disadvantages of both variants. Now let us offer you a shortened comparison table to simplify further decision and see which variant is more effective for your needs.\\n\\n<table>\\n   <tr style=\\\"background-color:lightblue\\\"><th>Development criteria</th><td>Single developer</td><td>Company</td></tr>\\n   <tr><th>Communication aspects</th><td>Expected as more convenient</td><td>Expected as less convenient</td></tr>\\n   <tr style=\\\"background-color:lightblue\\\"><th>Accessibility</th><td>Tentative</td><td>Rather high availability</td></tr>\\n   <tr><th>Procedure of control</th><td>Directly</td><td>Through the manager</td></tr>\\n   <tr style=\\\"background-color:lightblue\\\"><th>Time period</th><td>Expected as more quicker</td><td>Expected as more slower</td></tr>\\n   <tr><th>Service set</th><td>Rather thin</td><td>Broad</td></tr>\\n   <tr style=\\\"background-color:lightblue\\\"><th>Confidential protection</th><td>Risky</td><td>Reliable</td></tr>\\n   <tr><th>Further maintenance</th><td>Almost impossible</td><td>Usually supplied</td></tr>\\n   <tr style=\\\"background-color:lightblue\\\"><th>Finances</th><td>Cheaper</td><td>More Expensive</td></tr>\\n   <tr><th>Result</th><td>Medium</td><td>World-class quality</td></tr></table>\\n\\n## What to choose for website creation?\\n\\nThe process of creation and development of a high-quality and scalable website is rather tough and may be characterized as a multistage procedure. The decision of whom to employ may be influenced by a lot of various factors but the main is the result you are expecting to get. Are you eager to have a website that performs as it was planned? Is your wish to test your ideas with this project in order to check the audience feedback or to start your website as quickly as possible with minimum payments? Then, a single developer would be a convenient decision.\\n\\nHowever, keep in mind these things. A website created by a single developer is usually built to reach a certain goal that you define at the very beginning. It is hard to enhance it or make its features and possibilities wider as well as receive its further maintenance from the developer. \\n\\nMoreover, after a while, it also won’t be possible to make it follow new web-standards. Because of these reasons, we definitely advise you to employ one of the development companies. By contributing slightly more money and time in the very beginning you will get a scalable, competitive and open for further enhancement website.\\n\\n## What to choose for application development?\\n\\nThe content and the scope of application development industry may appear slightly easier than in the previous case. Nevertheless, keep in mind that an application is usually created in order to run on a specific platform and may face some problems with different stack, system or browser. \\n\\nMoreover, compared to websites, it is possible to find a lot of successful applications created by a single developer. In this situation, the decision may be divided into two equally-balanced variants. In case you require a simple application and are eager to save some time, then employ a freelancer. In case your goals higher – use the service of some organization.\\n\\n## Summary\\n![summary](/blog/content/images/2018/07/summary.png)\\nWell, the question of what is in more requested by the market now: single freelance developers or specialized IT consulting services organizations is rather tough. The world-wide evolution and popularization of freelancing is something like one of the first steps into a new age of contract relationships. Still, we cannot be so sure definitely. There are still a lot of things which only specialized teams are able to deal with. So define your goals and choose what will suit your business requirements best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>In case you are looking for an efficient <a href=\"https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development\">freelance web developer</a> or <a href=\"https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development\">freelance mobile application programmer</a>, you are able to choose from several variants.

The first and the cheaper one is to do all the\nrequired work yourself. This approach also demands rather a high level of\nknowledge and practice skills as well as a lot of free time. The second – to\nemploy some developer or even outsourcing company in order to have everything\nprepared by them. Following this way, you will have to decide on whom to give\nyour preference: a freelancer or a special development organization.\n\nYou are able to find a lot of developers on the Internet who are rather\nconfident that they can deal with all the development process alone without any\nhelp. Due to the unwritten rule, each of them has a really bright and colorful\nportfolio [https://2muchcoffee.com/portfolio]  where you may find a lot of great\nexamples of the websites and applications which they have worked on.\nNevertheless, you may also face some organization that specializes in such kind\nof activity as web development and, moreover, has rather large financial\nopportunities as well as the number of professional staff. All in all, there is\na vital and sensitive dilemma: whom to choose? What is the reason of hiring the\nentire enterprise when the single person is able to cover all the work amount or\nit is simply impossible to do this and that is why such organizations appear in\nthis niche of the industry?\n\nAs we know this dilemma can be complex, we have decided to make an effort in\nthis article to find out all the pros and cons of choosing both variants and\nthen make a comparison of them. As a quintessence of our clause, we will offer\nyou the most suitable situations for both variants.\n\nAdvantages of Employing a Freelance Developer.\n\nLet’s begin with a list of undoubtful advantages of Employing a Freelance\nDeveloper\n\nCommunications.\nIn case you work with a single developer, he/she entirely takes responsibility\nfor all the actions they do and achieved results. It means that the\ncommunicative process is rather simplified. In such a situation, the developer\ncannot shift responsibility for possible deadline delaying.\n\nUniversality.\nIt is okay for most of such developers to work extra time because such kind of\npeople usually is not obliged to work certain time periods. For this reason, it\nis possible for them to work on your project even after midnight, spend whole\ndays writing code lines and so on. You just need to be specific when proving the\ntask for a freelancer. Then the will do all other preparations and schedule\ntheir own time to perform the task.\n\nAffordable prices.\nSuch developer will ask payment for all services they offer. Nevertheless, after\nfinishing you will pay only for the result and work done. In the same time, an\norganization will definitely add all the extra costs into the final bill.\nExactly this is the reason why employing a single developer usually costs you\nless than dealing with a development studio.\n\nEfficiency.\nUsually, a single developer has rather high motivation to perform the job well\nand with rather high speed and productivity level. They are aware of the fact,\nthat their performance will have an impact on their profit. The other thing is\nthat a single developer wants to finish the task as fast as possible in order to\nget the price and won’t waste time on meaningless things or organizational\naspects as companies do.\n\nAlso read our article: 5 Best Tips to Hire Angular developer in 2018 [CHECKLIST]\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/hire-angular-developer/]\n\nDisadvantages Employing a Freelance Developer\n\nWe can predict that you may decide now that it is a brilliant idea to employ a\nfreelance developer which doesn’t have any cons. Nevertheless, there is a set of\nsome negative sides which you may face while working with a single developer.\n\nAvailability of a freelancer.\nIt is widely spread that an experienced and highly-skilled freelance developer\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/]  who also has a good reputation will have a few\nprojects he/she works on simultaneously. For this reason, there is a possibility\nthat a developer you have chosen for your project would be simply busy at the\nmoment of the necessity. Despite the fact that it is possible to reach an\nagreement beforehand and be sure and calm, in case you need someone to work just\nnow, you may face some troubles.\n\nDependence.\nDespite almost all freelance developers will try to finish the project as soon\nas possible, they would never feel anything similar to subordination or count\nthemselves as your stuff. In accordance with this, it is possible for them to\ncommit any actions related to their personal need and interests with no sense of\nnecessity to inform you. Actually, you even do not have any ability to deal with\nsuch a situation from your side.\n\nConfidential aspects.\nIn the IT industry a high level of confidential protection is vital for success\nand long-standing business. It is okay if you ratify a Non-disclosure agreement\nwith your freelance developer. Nevertheless, you cannot be 100% sure and aware\nof potential risk because the same freelance developer may deal with your\nopponent next time.\n\nSo, we have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Employing a Freelance\nDeveloper. Let’s do the same with the development company.\n\nAdvantages of Employing a development organization\n\nBefore starting you should remember that it is rather difficult for a single\ndeveloper to cover all the amount of work. It is clear that organizations have a\nwider set of possibilities in order to cover your demands and prepare more than\none developer can do. Moreover, an organization is able to supply you not only\nwith developing options but also with further maintaining of your project and\nits enhancement too. For this reason, let’s look at the main pluses and minuses\nof employing a development organization\n\nTeamwork.\nIn case cooperating with a company, you will get access to the capabilities of\nan entire team of professional programmers. As a result, a lot of various and\nefficient specialist in different spheres will be engaged in your project.\n\nTechnological back-end.\nIt is clear that in case you do not have a clear codebase created in accordance\nwith certain standards your application won’t be able to perform on different\nplatforms with the same level of effectiveness. That is why the backend should\nbe created due to your applications’ demands, which will ensure high-quality of\nyour application on various devices.\n\nConstant maintenance.\nThe really great advantage is that any development organization will not stop\nmaintaining your project just after its launch. Instead, its staff will be\nalways available in order to give a helping hand. In the same time, a freelance\nprogrammer won’t be simply able to supply your project with further maintenance\nbecause he/she doesn’t have enough tools and possibilities for such purpose.\n\nHigh-quality product.\nIt is impossible to find a website nominated for an award that is created by a\nsingle developer. In case you see some website full of elegance, swiftness,\nsmoothness, it can be guaranteed that it was created by an efficient team of\ndevelopers and other specialists. That is why, in case you are looking for\nsomething more than just simple realization, try to avoid single freelancers.\n\nCons of employing a development company\n\nDespite all the advantages, such an approach also has its cons and we consider\nourselves obliged to highlight them as well.\n\nMuch higher financial requirements.\nIt is necessary to repeat that hiring an entire organization is rather expensive\nand demands a wider budget than cooperating with a freelance developer.\nMoreover, an organization also includes some other expenses as office-rent,\ntaxes and so on.\n\nExtended development time.\nBecause of the approaches the companies use in the workflow, they need more time\nto finish projects. That doesn’t mean they work slowly. The reason is the\noverhead in the communication process and inner cooperation. In order to prepare\na better-quality result than a single developer, an organization will need at\nleast a few times longer period than a single developer.\n\nPossible Miscommunication.\nIn most cases, if you employ an organization you will definitely cooperate with\none responsible manager and he/she in his/her turn will organize the whole\nworkflow. As the result, your project will be developed by the people you may\nnever see. For this reason, the possibility of a misunderstanding between your\nthoughts and what developers understand is increased. One of the possible\nsolution to avoid that is to create specifications and instructions for the\ndevelopers beforehand. Nevertheless, the chance of misunderstanding will be\nstill high.\n\nDevelopment company versus a single developer\nWe have got acquainted with the list of the main advantages and disadvantages of\nboth variants. Now let us offer you a shortened comparison table to simplify\nfurther decision and see which variant is more effective for your needs.\n\nDevelopment criteriaSingle developerCompany\n Communication aspectsExpected as more convenientExpected as less convenient\n AccessibilityTentativeRather high availability\n Procedure of controlDirectlyThrough the manager\n Time periodExpected as more quickerExpected as more slower\n Service setRather thinBroad\n Confidential protectionRiskyReliable\n Further maintenanceAlmost impossibleUsually supplied\n FinancesCheaperMore Expensive\n ResultMediumWorld-class qualityWhat to choose for website creation?\nThe process of creation and development of a high-quality and scalable website\nis rather tough and may be characterized as a multistage procedure.

Despite just designating and working on that features of your marketplace which attract consumers, look deeper and find out the disadvantages and Achilles heels of your marketplace idea and the ways of dealing with them in order to enhance your online marketplace consumers’ detention level.\\n\\n### What are the potential cornerstones of your and consumer relations?\\n\\n* [User Interface or User experience](https://2muchcoffee.com/design)?\\n* Is the reason in trade or delivery services that perform poorly?\\n* Or the cornerstone is in the heart of applications’ code?\\n\\nKeep in mind that one of the most significant characteristics of a profitable and efficacious online marketplaces is their dynamism or constant developing. In case you need any evidences, check how often such giants as Google, Amazon and so on, is being developing, expanding the set of available elements and tools, fixing some inefficient or irrelevant parts and old modifications just to keep being one of the best. \\n\\nSome organizations decide to develop entirely new server-side or client-side parts, another just enhancing what they already have.\\n\\nThere is no certain rule of what to do and when. The permanent developing process entirely tied up with various factors such as the type of application or the type of industry tendencies. Let us help you to find out the most common circumstances in which the code developing is required.\\n\\n## General approaches of code enhancing as a necessary piece of total developing and upgrading online marketplace applications’ features set.\\n\\n![Sustainable-approaches-of-code-enhancing](/blog/content/images/2018/07/Sustainable-approaches-of-code-enhancing.jpg)\\nThe quintessential tip recommendation we are able to give is to refactor your applications’ code while developing it. It is not obligatory to refactor it regularly or once a day. Choose a period of a few months in order to assess your code quality and purity and do it in accordance with the necessity. Nevertheless, take into account the new tendencies of permanently developing and floating up modernized specifications and improvements in the programmers’ world.\\n\\nAccording to it, there are possibility that a simple annual refactoring may turn into entire rebuilding of the whole code skeleton of the application in order to make it in accordance with the new standards and technological platform. \\n\\nDue to the statistics, the main reason is the wrong usage of existing technologies that may cause a huge set of various but related between each other bugs and fails in the web or mobile app applications’ code which can be rather dangerous for its performance. It is rather apparent that such cause-and-effect relationships is caused by complex code that was written without further optimization.\\n\\n**In order to guard you from such situation, we offer you a few pieces of advice related to the refactoring approaches:**\\n\\n1.We recommend you not to use code redundancy while dealing with layout for your online marketplace application. In case there are some parts that repeat more than twice it is better to build a function that will run this fragment changing only some values in accordance with the demands of certain situation. Moreover, it may be rather effective to make a special place where the development team will keep all such functions and they will be available at any stage of development of your own online two sided marketplace application.\\n\\n2.Try also not to use too complex checking conditions and divide them in separated functions instead.\\n\\n3.Clarity and comprehensibility. Keep in mind that a computer understands any code without errors. Nevertheless, a developer can read only the code with understandable methods and parameters names. For this reason, our tip is to use the names that contains some logical weight. Due to the tradition, developers mostly use noun in order to sign their code parameters, while verbs in a role of prefixes are widely spread for functions.\\n\\n4.The rule of personal or single responsibility. It means that in case you create a function it should perform only one operation and do it perfectly. Try not to make one complex function in order to cover a few operations simultaneously.\\n\\nThe necessity of such effective JavaScript frameworks as Node.js, Vue.js and React Native has entirely ensured us that in case you are going to fill your two sided marketplace with a set of various tools as chatting, files exchanging, module of online support and so on, it is possible to keep its performance on high level. \\n\\nFor this reason, there are organizations that prefer to merge the platform they already have with the entirely new one or completely rebuild some certain elements with the help of the framework which will suit their product the most. Simultaneously, such owners, who prefer this approach, find this way how to enhance the level of consumers’ detention.\\n\\n### What did we mean writing “which will suit their product the most”?\\nChoosing the framework or even code-language for the project is no accident. There may be a huge set of various parameters which are able to influence the choice. They comprise not only the refactor dilemma but dealing with the web/mobile application technological platform updates.\\n\\n**In case you are still eager to create a product of the level of big commercial organization, you may need following set of recommended actions:**\\n\\n* Find a few technologically efficient masters or teach your developers group.\\n* Find out and summarize all the advantages of integration of some technological decision. Will it cause any influence on your profit?\\n* Do analyse the consequences of using another one and check whether it performs as the previous. Do the same with the usage capabilities and functionality.\\n\\n### In which cases it is not recommended to do refactoring?\\n![In-which-cases-it-is-not-recommended-to-do-refactoring](/blog/content/images/2018/07/In-which-cases-it-is-not-recommended-to-do-refactoring.jpg)\\nDespite all the effectiveness, the written approaches of code developing probably won’t solve your problems in case your application is based on a rather out-of-date and even archaic platform which simply destroys the flow of work of the whole marketplace application.\\n\\n* Keep in mind that almost the half of interviewed people chose to leave the website which requires more than 3-4 secs in order to download all the data (due to the Kissmetrics service). In our case, we even want to ensure you that the situation with the speed rate of online marketplace application will be pretty much similar.\\n\\nIn order to decrease the number of consumers that may decide to abandon your application, we have prepared a few potential plots and web or mobile plans of action to do:\\n\\n* Change the whole platform or all the out-of-date parts of it for modern one which would increase the speed rate of the running features of your application. Nevertheless, ensure that the responsible person is qualified in such questions\\n* Implement an additional or entirely modern element or tool for consumers which will make your application rather notable for them. For example, there is an online marketplace application that provides its consumers with an opportunity to look through the menus of different restaurants and cafes in surrounding area. In order to please the consumers, you are able to add a possibility to know about what food ingredients is used in the recipe of certain offered dish.\\n* Always modernize and enhance your applications’ user experience and interface in order to maintain its convenience.\\n* Target a new trade actions or even a list of such actions that fits your project such as outbound or inbound marketing, influencer marketing, social media marketing, partnership agreement and so on.\\n\\nNevertheless, keep in mind that there may be a situation when you simply have to be trendy and situations when, vice versa, strictly act in accordance with traditions.\\n\\nIn case you are interested, you may wonder how LinkedIn company has integrated [Node.js](https://2muchcoffee.com/nodejs-development) in their platform and speed up their applications’ running capabilities.\\n\\n## Testing and correctioning of your applications code\\n\\nThe member of your team who is responsible for quality control always have to do his job, especially he/she should control code enhancing or replacing the web or mobile tech platform. \\n\\nThe QA members of your team should test the application and report to you after each stage in order to help you with possible troubles. \\n\\n## The conclusion\\n![The-short-conclusion](/blog/content/images/2018/07/The-short-conclusion.jpg)\\nAll in all, the choice whether to change your out-of-date platform entirely or to employ some code refactoring approaches is up to you.

PrimeNG (https://www.primefaces.org/primeng)\\n![PrimeNG](/blog/content/images/2018/07/PrimeNG.png)\\n\\nUseful library, which provides more than 80 components for building UI of Angular applications. PrimeNG components are professionally designed, easy to use and customizable. There you can find simple form elements, as well as more complex ones - tables, graphs, sliders, pop-ups. Mobile UX is enhanced with touch optimizing and responsive layout. \\n\\nThe library has its own website with a detailed description of the available components and examples of working with them. Github rating - 4.2k stars.\\n\\n## 3. NGX Bootstrap (https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap)\\n![NGX-Bootstrap](/blog/content/images/2018/07/NGX-Bootstrap.jpg)\\n\\nIt's hard to imagine a front-end developer who haven’t heard about the Bootstrap framework. NGX Bootstrap is a popular library (at about 4K Github stars), which provides a lot of important Bootstrap capabilities for applying in Angular applications. Provides high performance and app scalability for all screen sizes and device types. Supports switching between Bootstrap v.3 and v.4. \\n\\nThe library has its own website with clear documentation and many examples, which makes it easier for newcomers to work with it.

NGRX (https://github.com/ngrx/platform)\\n![Ngrx-](/blog/content/images/2018/07/Ngrx-.jpg)\\n\\nAngular 2+ and reactive programming are inextricably linked through the deep integration of the RxJs library in Angular. NgRx is a set of libraries for describing and managing application state, interactions with the state by the redux pattern, used in Angular applications. \\n\\nThe main advantage of using such a scheme is to bring the application state to simple objects, provide a unidirectional data stream, interact with the external environment through predefined side-effects. Despite the complex state structure of the application, it makes sharing data in a complex application much easier and more understandable. About the popularity of this solution says 3.2k Github stars.\\n\\n## 6. NG-ZORRO (https://github.com/NG-ZORRO/ng-zorro-antd)\\n![NG-ZORRO](/blog/content/images/2018/07/NG-ZORRO.jpg)\\n\\n3k+ Github stars.

NGX Charts (https://swimlane.gitbook.io/ngx-charts)\\n\\n![NGX-Charts](/blog/content/images/2018/07/NGX-Charts.jpg)\\nPopular (2k+ Github stars) charting library for Angular 2+ still remains relevant. This unique project renders vector graphics by the Angular engine, and calculates mathematical functions, transformations, and others by the D3 library. Since the entire rendering process is performed by Angular, it makes it possible to control and influence this process, and also to optimize it with the use of technologies such as Ahead-of-Time and Server-Side Rendering.\\n\\n## 10. NGXS (https://github.com/ngxs/store)\\n\\n![NGXS](/blog/content/images/2018/07/NGXS.jpg)\\nUnlike of NGRX, which formally is a Redux port for Angular, the NGXS was created as state management pattern specially for Angular and perfecting it with modern abilities of TypeSctipt, such as interfaces, decorators and classes, because of what NGXS will be more user-friendly for Angular developers. Now, this fast-growing project is gaining an increasing audience among the Angular developers, which is confirmed by 1.2k Github stars in less than 6 months. On the official site, there is clear documentation, as well as many examples and tutorials.\\n\\n## 11. NGX Restangular (https://ngx-restangular.com)\\n![ngx-restangular-1](/blog/content/images/2018/07/ngx-restangular-1.jpg)\\n\\nGrowing in popularity Angular 2+ service, which allows to simplify realization of common HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, DELETE, and UPDATE with a few lines of code. It is best to use for mobile and desktop applications that involve the exchange of data with some RESTful API. \\n\\nAmong the advantages are the following:\\n\\n* support of both promises and observables;\\n* ability to send HTTP requests from within JavaScript objects;\\n* ability to specify custom names instead of insignificant URLs;\\n* ability to create custom HTTP methods;\\n\\n## 12. NGX Fullpage (https://github.com/meiblorn/ngx-fullpage)\\n![NGX-Fullpage](/blog/content/images/2018/07/NGX-Fullpage.jpg)\\n\\nThis awesome library is a wrapper of fullPage.js for the Angular 2+ platform. It was implemented as a set of Angular directives for applying fullpage.js functionality in applications. This solution makes possible to create fullscreen scrolling for vertically and horizontally oriented websites (one-page scrolling sites). New versions provide support of touch events on different screens and devices and are compatible with Angular v.6, including AoT and Universal technologies. \\n\\nDuring the writing of the article, many libraries for the Angular developers were reviewed and tested. The above libraries are the most comprehensive and popular solutions to relevant tasks in the context of modern Angular 6 development. We hope that this article will help you to search and choose the approach to handle everyday issues in the process of web development.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>AngularJS was developed by Google in 2009 and in 2012 version 1.0 was released.

Similar start-ups, like the above-mentioned Uber, are representatives of the new business model that we call platform. Such platforms provide very large growth and rapid development for any business. But their development is a very laborious process, which differs from building a business model that is familiar to us.\\n \\n## What is the difference between a scalable Peer-to-Peer platform and a traditional business?\\n\\nOne of the oldest business models is to find new technologies, and with their help, to undermine traditional enterprises, introduce innovations and create new sources of wealth. There are some intermediaries, which connect different groups of their customers (for example, drivers and passengers, as in the case of Uber) and help them negotiate with each other. The platforms they manage offer participants a simple and effective way to interact and do business.\\n\\nUnlike traditional business models, intermediaries do not need to purchase raw materials, produce items, and then distribute it. Instead, they attract participants to their platforms and then reduce them to others. You can say that these people - this is the \\\"raw materials\\\" from which they produce their intermediary services. Thus, the platform divides people into producers and consumers.\\n\\n## How to build interaction-first marketplace?\\n![interaction-first-marketplace](/blog/content/images/2018/08/interaction-first-marketplace.png)\\n### Remove the barriers\\nThere is no place for a gatekeeper. So producers can easily get access to the consumers market. One such platform can be called YouTube, as well as Amazon Kindle Publishing. [Scalable Peer-to-Peer markets](https://2muchcoffee.com/ecommerce-saas), like eBay, also use a similar system with minimum delays and maximum protection level, thereby providing income to millions of people.\\n\\n### Applying experience\\nWhat do we know about brick-and-mortar marketplace? Such type of complex system of interactions constantly worked on optimizing resources and over the balance of supply / demand. \\n\\nAfter all, it is a complex optimization process, which helps to promote and improve the business (going from improving the materials of production to improving in the sales department). Nevertheless, experience with platforms shows that they do not have the need to invest in infrastructure or physical assets. Therefore, working with them is much easier.\\n\\nLet's look at an example. In our time, e-books have become an essential part of the life of many Internet users. Accordingly, a lot of people willingly give their money to read an online book they like. As we understand, the manufacturer must acquire the necessary set of tools in order to provide a mechanism for processing, publishing and selling electronic texts. \\n\\nAlso, this mechanism should provide for flexibility in relation to the different sizes of the screens of buyers' devices, and ready to be optimized for bigger screens, if it's needed. Therefore, the optimization process is extremely important.\\n\\n### Repeatable actions\\nYou must create a user-friendly environment. Repeatability must make creation, curation and consume actions platform-users much easier.

After all, in our time, [app development](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development) for an online shopping is the best way to keep in touch with customers and increase sales on the web and on mobile platforms. The mobile apps market is [developing a marketplace](https://2muchcoffee.com/ecommerce-saas) with leaps and bounds. Go to the App Store or Google Play, and you'll be shocked by the abundance of shopping apps.\\n\\nE-commerce is entrenched as one of the main ways of buying for many consumers. It's safe to say that consumers switched to the convenience and availability of online transactions. However, along with the development of technology, e-commerce is also developing. The simplicity and accessibility of e-commerce have evolved into mobile platform commerce. M-commerce is not just a modern trend, but also almost a standard in online shopping.\\n\\nThe world is becoming digital. And e-commerce marketplace is an important part of this transformation. The more developed the country's economy is, the more the volume of the online trade market becomes. This is particularly evident in the case of Western countries. On a global scale, e-commerce in 2017 showed an impressive increase of 16%+, reaching $ 1.5 trillion.Do you want to build a Marketplace? What about prospects and fails?\\n\\nMarketplace app development for e-commerce can bring great prospects, but at the same time entail some technical difficulties. In our time, a typical e-commerce marketplace is not responsible for the quality of the content hosted in the application, nor for the delivery. In this connection, many companies fail, and such platforms as Wish try to stay afloat and keep in touch with users in all ways. But what you need to know, in order that such a situation does not happen? Let's figure it out what important things we need to consider, and how to create a right mobile app.\\n\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Freelancer vs Development company. Your Business Choice [2018]](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/freelance-vs-development-company/)</b>\\n\\n## Wish platform app Development Based\\n![wish-platform](/blog/content/images/2018/08/wish-platform.png)\\n\\nA well-known mobile application Wish from San Francisco was originally developed in order to satisfy the desires of customers. The program recommended suitable items and offered related offers with possible discounts. ContextLogic has always been able to find an approach with people and provide them with very profitable deals. The company continues to grow. Now Wish app has turned into the [largest shopping platform](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/build-uber-like-marketplaces/), which interacts with various brands, manufacturers, craftsmen, and other merchants and buyers.\\n\\nThis commerce platform is a kind of intermediary between buyers and traders, who in turn are responsible for the provision of certain services and goods. Thus, Wish only connects these two, but does not participate in transactions and does not allow redirecting customers to original websites and stores.\\n\\n**So why is Wish app such a popular on the competitive e-commerce market?**\\n \\n## What e-commerce businesses model does Wish use?\\n\\nAt the beginning of its career, the application worked as a service for coupons. But now Wish has become a powerful fast-growing platform, which is available on iOS and Android mobile platforms.\\n\\nBut what is their guarantee of success? Let's think about it. How does an ordinary person go to the store? Many people decide what to buy on the spot because not all people have a pre-prepared shopping list. Seeing in front of a wide range of attractive products from various categories, we do not strive to buy everything at once. But at the same time, there is something special that makes us buy something specific in the store.\\n\\nProceeding from this, many companies like Walmart get great revenue because of their ability to carry out correct advertisement of the goods or provide lower prices so that the buyer aspires to buy the goods (and did not worry about the brand at all).\\n\\n**Top 3 Wish strategies**\\n* Ability to push customers and offer a wide range of products,\\n* Focus on mobile platforms,\\n* A large number of large discount.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [SAAS Website development: 6 Top mistakes (How to fix them!)](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/6-mistakes-developing-saas-website/)</b>\\n\\n## Multi-app approach\\n![multi-app-aproach](/blog/content/images/2018/08/multi-app-aproach.png)\\n\\nA small addition - the company uses about six software products to promote various categories of goods.\\n\\n1. Wish \\\"Shopping made fun\\\" – a top app with a user-friendly interface, that focused on various types of items (from makeup products, bags, and watches to different gadgets). It is the most advertised application in the company.\\n2. Geek \\\"Smarter Shopping\\\" – smaller app related to digital devices and relevant accessories;\\n3. Mama \\\"Thoughtful shopping\\\" – for young mothers, who are looking for babies products and items for pregnant women.\\n4. Cute \\\"Beauty shopping\\\" – focus on beauty products, clothes, accessories, etc.\\n5. Home \\\"Design and Decor\\\" – app related to the home décor (different accessories for bedroom, living room, kitchen appliances, etc.)\\n6. Wish app for sellers – a specific app that allows merchants to register their information about the company (name, product categories, location, and revenue share), and to monitor the accounts. In turn, customers can evaluate stores and individual products.\\n\\nThe principle of multi-app is used everywhere: many websites and social networks already used it. For example, Facebook came to the point that, to serve users by sharing them on tablet-users and mobile-user is much easier and more practical.\\n\\nBut this approach does not always attract customers. Since many people value their time and aim to enter the application to purchase a certain product. Instead of viewing a bunch of objects that they do not need.\\n\\n## Main features of Shopping made fun\\n![main-features-shopping-made-fun](/blog/content/images/2018/08/main-features-shopping-made-fun.png)\\n\\n### - Personalized filters\\n\\nThe application suggests telling the user about himself (by entering information about sex, date of birth, preferences and selecting several categories), and based on this, suitable products will be matched.\\n\\nBut as practice shows, the mobile application only slightly narrows the global search for products. Perhaps to familiarize each person with a wide variety of products. Of course, Wish is focused on impulsive buyers who, in search of suitable products, will buy more and more items.\\n\\nIt turns out that the system of selecting goods works not only on the principle \\\"I like it\\\", but it also takes into account what a person does not like. Thus optimizing the process of selecting goods.\\n\\nSo if you develop a shopping app do not forget to add a Tinder-like interface for choosing items. An example is a Fancy application, which uses a user-friendly interface based on interactions with baskets.

But what is the difference between [auction marketplace](https://2muchcoffee.com/ecommerce-saas) and common marketplace? The answer is that the first one does not have the fixed price, so products and services cost much cheaper. In this case, the buyer bids, but eventually the goods are sent to the person who offered the highest amount of money. And most importantly, the process is completely transparent to both sides.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [10 Best and Simple tips of building B2B Marketplace step-by-step](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/building-b2b-marketplace-guide/)</b>\\n\\n## You can organize such types of the auction on your own online website:\\n\\n## Increment auction (#1)\\n\\nThe essence of this type of auction is that the rate increases by a certain number. That is, when the maximum rate is overlapped, the current auction bid must increase by at least a given number.\\n\\n*For example, you can look at automatic bidding on Ebay.\\nSo, if the current price of the item is about $0,01 to $0,99, that bid increment must be about 5 cents. Another example: if you sell something and say that minimal price for it is twenty dollars and the increment bid is ten dollars. When the bid placed at the fifty dollars level, it automatically increases by ten dollars. After this, the minimum bid will be sixty dollars.*\\n\\n## Automatic auction (#2)\\n\\nOne of the easiest methods to bid.\\nThis method is based on the maximum buyer's offer. The buyer offers the maximum amount of money that he is willing to pay for a certain product. After that, on his behalf, a bet is placed in the system. If another bidder invites more money, the previous entry is deleted and a new maximum bid occurs in its place.\\n\\n## Reserve price auction (#3)\\nIn the latter case, the buyer says the minimum price to buy. Usually, this price is hidden, so people participating in the auction can only watch the result. When reserve price is met, a bid with the highest price is carried out.\\n\\n*For example, if you sell a certain product with such conditions: reserve price - thirty dollars, and starting price - five dollars. When buyers start bidding at $ 5 and in the end, the product does not reach $ 30, your product will not be sold.*\\n\\n## Online auction website\\n![online-auction-webstie](/blog/content/images/2018/08/online-auction-webstie.png)\\nMany people think that the auction site is always must be related to the retail industry. But it is not always true.\\n\\nSuch type of marketplaces is also connected with restaurant and food, real estate, finance, automotive, logistics, and art industries.\\n\\n*Here are some real examples of Online Auction Marketplaces for you:*\\n\\n### Honcho\\nOnline marketplace type # 3 for financial services. This application works with car insurance in the UK. It allows insurers to compete among themselves in order to provide the business of consumers with the best insurance package. Thus, any person can find a suitable offer for himself, leave an application and buy a service from a certain insurer.\\n\\n### Artsy\\nBest place for selling/buying and exploring art masterpieces.\\n\\n### Salvagebid\\nA nice online auction that helps to bid for right vehicles anytime and anywhere. They sorted by types (motorcycles, vans, boats, trucks, etc.), brands, models and year range. The company provides flexible memberships and nice customer support.\\n\\n## Central participants\\n![central-participants](/blog/content/images/2018/08/central-participants.png)\\nAll participants of the multi-sided platform depend on each other. Therefore, when developing a similar marketplace, you need to interest all sellers and service providers, buyers, and online operator. And the faster you attract a large number of customers and provide access to main features, the better.\\n \\n### What features you need to provide\\n\\n**1. For buyers**\\n1.1.Advanced dashboard (to communicate with other people, send files, view activity history, statistic, and revenue, and the main thing - to work with bids)\\n1.2.Listing feature for controlling the process (helps to add new members, select type and add details about products)\\n1.3.Online evaluation of any item (before selling products you need to get an accurate quality assessment and compute value)\\n\\nNice examples: a Worthy marketplace that works with luxury jewelry and Iamsold that work with real estate. Both have a built-in calculator for the price.\\n\\n**2.For sellers**\\n2.1.Purchase history\\n2.2.Opportunity to set a starting price\\n2.3.Rating system\\n2.4.Advanced filters\\n2.5.Wishlist\\n2.6.Real-time bid\\n\\n**3.For online operator**\\n3.1.Manage actions\\n3.2.Work with the description of auctions, bids, categories, lots\\n3.3.Manage verification, rating system and email system\\n \\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [6 Top Peer to peer [P2P] Marketplace apps for Android in 2018](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/p2p-marketplace-apps/)</b> \\n \\n## Ensuring security and transparency of transactions\\n\\n### Security and trust\\nOf course, to increase the number of users, you need to work on the security system.

So let’s close look at the main questions related to the branding:\n\n“Branding” - what does it mean?\nNo one can give an exact answer to this question since in academic and business\ncircles there are various opinions and representations of this concept. In the\ngeneral definition: the goal of branding is to create a new brand that will have\nits values, philosophy and quality visual embodiment. The very word “branding”\nrelated to the main areas of PR, marketing, and advertising.\n\nThere are many different opinions. Some people use the word branding for\nproducts, others use this word from the point of view of companies. Some people\nevaluate this visually, while others do not.\n\nOne of the best definitions of branding was provided by Shopify.

For any businessman, it is\nimportant to understand the difference, while the company sees its brand and how\nthe users perceive it.\n\nAfter all, even the most popular company like McDonald's has both admirers and\ndetractors. For some, Toyotas are good and affordable cars, for others - they\nare cheap.\n\nBranding consists of many factors, personal values and goals of the client,\ntherefore the company should be targeted at a segment (and take into account the\nage, gender, and income of people).\n\nTherefore, the more accurate the audience choice, the more successful the\ncompany will have. Do your research. Learn the needs, habits, and desires of\nyour current and potential customers. Do not guess what they think. Know what\nthey think. All this should be taken into account when developing functions,\nchoosing the direction of the company - mobile phones or computers development\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/], Apple or Android, what you need to write about\nsocial networks, etc.\n\nFew words about inspiration\n\nBrand positioning inspiration, let's look at a few examples of the most\nsuccessful companies.\n\nAirbnb\nIn 2014, the company underwent a rebranding. Namely, rebranding included the\nBelong Anywhere page. Airbnb claims that they help people to revive the notion\nof \"society\"; sharing your home, you can visit others. An important part of\nbranding is to be able to distinguish your company from the rest.\n\nService creates its own cozy atmosphere, and we can immediately distinguish it\nfrom the similar companies like Booking.com.\n\nLyft\nA well-known transportation company that has been working on its rebranding for\na long time to withstand its main competitor, Uber. Although both companies\nprovide similar services, Lyft positions itself as your friend with the car.\n\nThumbtack\nBecame \"available online\". The company positions itself as a service uniting\ncustomers who need professional help.

Thanks to MVC architecture, it’s more simple than other frameworks. In addition to it, if your team is working in tandem with another one, both of you can control the system.\\n### 2. Configurable with help of directives\\nAnother advantage of this framework is that it uses HTML and it makes possible the usage of directives that helps the developers to work with better efficiency. Besides, you can save time after making customized tags and reusing them for the code readability.\\n### 3. Maintenance of the core development team and support of the Angular community\\nAngular is maintained by its core development team which is interested in improving this framework so they let contributors commit some minor upgrades and fixes. As a result, the big worldwide community and Angular-around events help developers be in touch with each other and find the answers they need. \\n### 4. Simplifies web app creating with MVC architecture\\nAs it was mentioned above, Angular uses MVC architecture. It allows to divide data, and view, while the remaining part is on Angular.  So that both single page applications can be developed and XMLHttpRequest and JSONP requests from communicating with remote HTTP servers can be used. It simplifies web app creating and saves your time.\\n### 5. Functionality and flexibility with help of modules\\nAngular is using the modular technique. If you want to improve your web app’s functionality and flexibility, you can split the app into modules. These modules can hinge upon each other or not. That provides a better app’s architecture and fastens a workflow, too. \\n### 6. Simplification of the testing\\nLet’s talk about the testing phase of your application now. You can simplify the testing of the web app using Angular. When you put parts of the apps into framework modules, you can manipulate them simply. So, when the web app is built with Angular it’s linked by dependency injection and that means that the sample data can be injected into the component and the result is measured while testing.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Top Tips for those who is Hiring Angular Developer](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/hire-angular-developer/)</b>\\n\\n![conclusion](/blog/content/images/2018/09/conclusion.png)\\nAs you can see there are many advantages of developing your web app using Angular.

But after visiting places where free Wi-Fi points are something rare, and catching a normal 3G Internet is a great success, you begin to understand that a huge number of users have to wait for the website being downloaded by the browser. \\n\\nIn the context of developing simple websites without using any frameworks, this problem does not seem to be so critical. But if you have an app and don’t want to make users with low internet speed wait, it’s important to optimize the application.\\n\\n## Any website can be optimized, following the next recommendations:\\n![static-web-optimization](/blog/content/images/2018/10/static-web-optimization.jpg)\\n\\n1. All images on the web page should be compressed and optimized with the appropriate tools. For example, .png - https://tinypng.com/, .jpg - https://tinyjpg.com/. For to minify .svg images there is a popular command line tool SVGO (https://github.com/svg/svgo).\\n\\n2. The styles responsible for displaying the page elements, visible to the user in the first place, should be taken from the connected CSS files into the internal styles. This will allow them to work right after loading the HTML document, without waiting for the files with external styles to be loaded by the browser.\\n\\n3. If the page includes a lot of images, you should think about the advisability of implementing the functionality for delaying loading of them. For example, images can be loaded while the user is scrolling the page.\\n\\n4. And of course, we should not forget about the most popular way to replace the white screen of the loading page with something more pleasant - remember to use loaders.\\n\\nFollowing the abovementioned tips, you can significantly speed up, optimize and make more user-friendly almost any STATIC web page. \\n\\nBut what about the SPA? Let's try to consider this case on the example of the Angular application.\\n\\n## Angular SPA optimization\\n![angular-spa-optimization](/blog/content/images/2018/10/angular-spa-optimization.jpg)\\n\\nIn the process of assembling the application, Webpack makes its compilation from the TypeScript into the Javascript, minification and the separation of the entire application to the bundles. Initially, as in the case of a static web page, the browser loads the document itself. The body of the document initially lacks HTML markup of the page and only contains a selector of the root Angular component and links to the bundles.\\n\\n```\\n<body>\\n<app-root></app-root>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\"\\nsrc=\\\"runtime.a66f828dca56eeb90e02.js\\\"></script>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"polyfills.2f4a59095805af02bd79.js\\\"></script>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"main.d5dc696e4b174c63311e.js\\\"></script>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nWhen the document is loaded, the browser starts downloading of the bundles (main, inline, styles, polyfills etc…). And only after loading and executing all the bundles the launch of the Angular application will be initiated and the components will be displayed.\\n\\nIn case of a slow internet connection speed, the time spent for loading the Angular bundles often exceeds 10 seconds, that is a crime against UX.\\n\\nAt what, in this case, the abovementioned recommendations for speeding up the loading of the website will not help us, except for using a loader. I think the reason is obvious:\\n* **firstly**, optimized images will load faster, but only AFTER launching Angular applications; \\n* **secondly**, internal styles also will not help, because the elements for which they are responsible will be rendered only AFTER the application's launch; \\n* **thirdly**, delayed loading of images will also work after rendering the component template only where they are used.\\n\\nIt turns out that it is the most rational and the easiest to implement to work with the \\\"white screen\\\" in the period before the launch of the SPA using the loader. In this case, there is no need to develop logic for the transition from the display of the loader to the display of the application itself. \\n\\nNamely, due to the fact that the HTML layout located inside the selector of the root component is visible to the user exactly before the Angular application starts working and renders the root component. Using this, we can arrange the layout of the loader inside the selector \\\"app-root\\\", and its styles - internally in the head of the document. In fact, in addition to the loader inside the selector, we can display anything within the capabilities of the static page. All this increases the volume of the original document loaded and ultimately postpones the launch of the Angular application.\\n\\nSuppose that we need to display the logo of the company in addition to the loader. In accordance with the abovementioned, the logo should have a minimum size, and it is desirable to be presented as a string in the base64 encoding or as the inline SVG.\\n\\nTo do this, let's add the layout of the preloading screen inside the app-root tag:\\n\\n```\\n...\\n<app-root>\\n  <div class=\\\"preview\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"logo\\\">\\n      <img alt=\\\"Angular Logo\\\" src=\\\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,\\nPHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9I\\njAgMCAyNTAgMjUwIj4KICAgIDxwYXRoIGZpbGw9IiNERDAwMzEiIGQ9Ik0xMjUgMz\\nBMMzEuOSA2My4ybDE0LjIgMTIzLjFMMTI1IDIzMGw3OC45LTQzLjcgMTQuMi0xMjM\\nuMXoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjQzMwMDJGIiBkPSJNMTI1IDMwdjIyLjIt\\nLjFWMjMwbDc4LjktNDMuNyAxNC4yLTEyMy4xTDEyNSAzMHoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0a\\nCAgZmlsbD0iI0ZGRkZGRiIgZD0iTTEyNSA1Mi4xTDY2LjggMTgyLjZoMjEuN2wxMS\\n43LTI5LjJoNDkuNGwxMS43IDI5LjJIMTgzTDEyNSA1Mi4xem0xNyA4My4zaC0zNGw\\nxNy00MC45IDE3IDQwLjl6IiAvPgogIDwvc3ZnPg==\\\">\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"loader\\\">\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n      <div></div>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n</app-root>\\n...\\n```\\n\\nHere we have preview container with base64 encoded logo and animated loader. For the speedy display, we put the styles internally in the head of the document.\\n\\n```\\n<head>\\n...\\n<style>\\n    * {\\n      box-sizing: border-box;\\n    }\\n\\n    body {\\n      margin: 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    .preview {\\n      position: relative;\\n      display: flex;\\n      flex-direction: column;\\n      justify-content: center;\\n      align-items: center;\\n      width: 100vw;\\n      height: 100vh;\\n      margin: auto;\\n    }\\n\\n    .logo {\\n      width: 285px;\\n      height: 300px;\\n      margin-bottom: 20px;\\n    }\\n\\n    .loader {\\n      position: relative;\\n      display: flex;\\n      justify-content: space-between;\\n      align-items: stretch;\\n      flex-wrap: wrap;\\n      width: 109px;\\n      height: 109px;\\n    }\\n\\n    .loader > div {\\n      position: relative;\\n      display: inline-block;\\n      width: 35px;\\n      height: 35px;\\n      background: tomato;\\n      transform: scale(0.0);\\n      transform-origin: center center;\\n      animation: loader 2s infinite linear;\\n    }\\n\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(1),\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(5),\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(9) {\\n       animation-delay: 0.4s;\\n    }\\n\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(4),\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(8) {\\n       animation-delay: 0.2s;\\n    }\\n\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(2),\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(6) {\\n       animation-delay: 0.6s;\\n    }\\n\\n    .loader > div:nth-of-type(3) {\\n       animation-delay: 0.8s;\\n    }\\n\\n    @keyframes loader {\\n      0%   { transform: scale(0.0); }\\n      40%  { transform: scale(1.0); }\\n      80%  { transform: scale(1.0); }\\n      100% { transform: scale(0.0); }\\n    }\\n  </style>\\n</head>\\n```\\n\\nNow, all the time it takes to download and run the Angular application, the user will see the preloading page, and as soon as the application is launched, the root component will be rendered instead.\\n![angular-application-preloading-page](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed.png)\\n\\n## Conclusions\\nFrom this moment, you can start optimizing the page taking into account all the above recommendations. And again we will stop on the loader. The loader we just applied can no longer be used anywhere in the application. If there is a need to display the loader (for example, to indicate the execution time of the HTTP request), it will be necessary to create a new loader component, that will be part of the Angular application.\\n\\nTo test the work of the loader before launching the Angular application, open Chrome Dev Tools and throttle network speed to \\\"Slow 3G\\\".\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Fortunately, the citizens of developed countries don’t worry about problems due to the low speed of the Internet.

But after visiting places where free Wi-Fi\npoints are something rare, and catching a normal 3G Internet is a great success,\nyou begin to understand that a huge number of users have to wait for the website\nbeing downloaded by the browser.\n\nIn the context of developing simple websites without using any frameworks, this\nproblem does not seem to be so critical. But if you have an app and don’t want\nto make users with low internet speed wait, it’s important to optimize the\napplication.\n\nAny website can be optimized, following the next recommendations:\n\n\n 1. All images on the web page should be compressed and optimized with the\n    appropriate tools. For example, .png - https://tinypng.com/, .jpg - \n    https://tinyjpg.com/. For to minify .svg images there is a popular command\n    line tool SVGO (https://github.com/svg/svgo).\n    \n    \n 2. The styles responsible for displaying the page elements, visible to the user\n    in the first place, should be taken from the connected CSS files into the\n    internal styles. This will allow them to work right after loading the HTML\n    document, without waiting for the files with external styles to be loaded by\n    the browser.\n    \n    \n 3. If the page includes a lot of images, you should think about the\n    advisability of implementing the functionality for delaying loading of them.\n    For example, images can be loaded while the user is scrolling the page.\n    \n    \n 4. And of course, we should not forget about the most popular way to replace\n    the white screen of the loading page with something more pleasant - remember\n    to use loaders.\n    \n    \n\nFollowing the abovementioned tips, you can significantly speed up, optimize and\nmake more user-friendly almost any STATIC web page.\n\nBut what about the SPA? Let's try to consider this case on the example of the\nAngular application.\n\nAngular SPA optimization\n\n\nIn the process of assembling the application, Webpack makes its compilation from\nthe TypeScript into the Javascript, minification and the separation of the\nentire application to the bundles. Initially, as in the case of a static web\npage, the browser loads the document itself. The body of the document initially\nlacks HTML markup of the page and only contains a selector of the root Angular\ncomponent and links to the bundles.\n\n<body>\n<app-root></app-root>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"\nsrc=\"runtime.a66f828dca56eeb90e02.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"polyfills.2f4a59095805af02bd79.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"main.d5dc696e4b174c63311e.js\"></script>\n</body>\n\n\nWhen the document is loaded, the browser starts downloading of the bundles\n(main, inline, styles, polyfills etc…). And only after loading and executing all\nthe bundles the launch of the Angular application will be initiated and the\ncomponents will be displayed.\n\nIn case of a slow internet connection speed, the time spent for loading the\nAngular bundles often exceeds 10 seconds, that is a crime against UX.\n\nAt what, in this case, the abovementioned recommendations for speeding up the\nloading of the website will not help us, except for using a loader. I think the\nreason is obvious:\n\n * firstly, optimized images will load faster, but only AFTER launching Angular\n   applications;\n * secondly, internal styles also will not help, because the elements for which\n   they are responsible will be rendered only AFTER the application's launch;\n * thirdly, delayed loading of images will also work after rendering the\n   component template only where they are used.\n\nIt turns out that it is the most rational and the easiest to implement to work\nwith the \"white screen\" in the period before the launch of the SPA using the\nloader. In this case, there is no need to develop logic for the transition from\nthe display of the loader to the display of the application itself.\n\nNamely, due to the fact that the HTML layout located inside the selector of the\nroot component is visible to the user exactly before the Angular application\nstarts working and renders the root component. Using this, we can arrange the\nlayout of the loader inside the selector \"app-root\", and its styles - internally\nin the head of the document. In fact, in addition to the loader inside the\nselector, we can display anything within the capabilities of the static page.\nAll this increases the volume of the original document loaded and ultimately\npostpones the launch of the Angular application.\n\nSuppose that we need to display the logo of the company in addition to the\nloader. In accordance with the abovementioned, the logo should have a minimum\nsize, and it is desirable to be presented as a string in the base64 encoding or\nas the inline SVG.\n\nTo do this, let's add the layout of the preloading screen inside the app-root\ntag:\n\n...\n<app-root>\n  <div class=\"preview\">\n    <div class=\"logo\">\n      <img alt=\"Angular Logo\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,\nPHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9I\njAgMCAyNTAgMjUwIj4KICAgIDxwYXRoIGZpbGw9IiNERDAwMzEiIGQ9Ik0xMjUgMz\nBMMzEuOSA2My4ybDE0LjIgMTIzLjFMMTI1IDIzMGw3OC45LTQzLjcgMTQuMi0xMjM\nuMXoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjQzMwMDJGIiBkPSJNMTI1IDMwdjIyLjIt\nLjFWMjMwbDc4LjktNDMuNyAxNC4yLTEyMy4xTDEyNSAzMHoiIC8+CiAgICA8cGF0a\nCAgZmlsbD0iI0ZGRkZGRiIgZD0iTTEyNSA1Mi4xTDY2LjggMTgyLjZoMjEuN2wxMS\n43LTI5LjJoNDkuNGwxMS43IDI5LjJIMTgzTDEyNSA1Mi4xem0xNyA4My4zaC0zNGw\nxNy00MC45IDE3IDQwLjl6IiAvPgogIDwvc3ZnPg==\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"loader\">\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</app-root>\n...\n\n\nHere we have preview container with base64 encoded logo and animated loader.

A lot was discussed and written about their strengths and weaknesses. Some frameworks are more productive, others are less, some are more complex, while others are easier to learn. This article is primarily focused on those who have some experience in web development, are familiar with JavaScript and are planning to study a new framework, but cannot decide which one to choose.\\n\\nBased on the available comparisons of popular frameworks, Angular is ideally suited for building large and medium-sized scalable mobile and web applications. At the same time, one of the shortcomings that’s often mentioned is the complexity of learning. To avoid this, consider an example of creating a simple Angular application to display the weather forecast.\\n\\nIt should be mentioned that Angular uses TypeScript language. Do not worry if you have not worked with it before. In short, TypeScript is a typed JavaScript with some new features. There is extensive documentation available on the official website (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html), as well as many examples and tutorials on various web resources.\\n\\n## Step 1: Preparing the environment\\n![step-1-preparing-the-environment](/blog/content/images/2018/10/step-1.png)\\n\\nThe first thing you need for starting development is Node.js installed. The current version for your platform can be downloaded from the official site (https://nodejs.org/en/download). It comes with the Node Package Manager (NPM) which will also be installed. It’s required to load the project’s dependencies. To verify that the installation is successful, run the following commands:\\n\\n> **node -v\\nnpm -v**\\n\\nYou should receive the versions of the corresponding packages, that means the installation was successful and we can continue.\\nNext, you need to install global support of TypeScript language in your system. To do this, execute the next command in your terminal:\\n\\n> **npm install -g typescript**\\n\\nThe flag -g (the short form from the --global) indicates that this package will be installed globally in the system (more information on the use of NPMs is available on the official website (https://docs.npmjs.com) ).\\nIt is also necessary to install the Angular CLI globally (the command line interface from the Angular team, which greatly simplifies the application development process):\\n\\n> **npm install -g @angular/cli**\\n\\nAfter the installation of the mentioned packages is successfully completed, you can start creating the Angular application itself. To do this, you need to execute the following command in CLI inside the directory with your projects:\\n\\n> **ng new weather-app --style scss**\\n\\n*Note: without flag --style [scss, stylus, less] CSS preprocessors will not be used by default for the project.*\\n\\nThis command generates a new Angular application with the specified name and using SASS as the default CSS preprocessor (more details about the Angular CLI commands can be found in the official documentation (https://cli.angular.io) ). As a result, a new project directory will be created with the base application template inside. To start the application, go to its directory:\\n\\n> **cd weather-app**\\n\\nand run the development server:\\n\\n>**ng serve**\\n\\nNow, visiting [<span style=\\\"color:green;\\\">http://localhost:4200/</span>](http://localhost:4200/), you should see the view of **your first Angular application**.\\n\\n## Step 2: Developing weather component\\n![step-2-developing-weather-component](/blog/content/images/2018/10/step-2.png)\\n\\nInside the project’s **./src/app** folder there is root component of the application - app.component located. It is still the only one in the project. One of the best practices is to take out a wrapper component outside the app.component. In our case, the wrapper component will be weather.component. Let's create it with the following Angular CLI command:\\n\\n>**ng generate component weather**\\n\\nAs a result, the directory of the new component “weather” is created in the folder **./src/app** with the following files:\\n* *weather.component.scss* - the component styles;\\n* *weather.component.html* - the component view template;\\n* *weather.component.spec.ts* - the component unit tests;\\n* *weather.component.ts* - the component file itself.\\n\\nLet’s focus on Component decorator where the metadata of our component is indicated:\\n\\n``` javascript\\n@Component({\\n selector: 'app-weather',\\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\\n})\\n```\\n\\nSelector is an identifier for the component usage in templates of other components, templateUrl and styleUrl are links to the template file and component styles. In addition, after component creation, Angular CLI declares it in the application module, which allows it to be used immediately in other components that are declared in this module.\\n\\n**app.module.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather/weather.component';\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n declarations: [\\n   AppComponent,\\n   WeatherComponent\\n ],\\n imports: [\\n   BrowserModule\\n ],\\n providers: [],\\n bootstrap: [AppComponent]\\n})\\nexport class AppModule { }\\n```\\n\\nIn other words, we can apply the weather component inside *the root component - app component*. So, let's organize our application this way - add weather component to the app component as its child. **app.component.html** should look like this:\\n```\\n<app-weather></app-weather>\\n```\\n\\nAfter saving the changes, the development server will refresh the page in the browser and you will see the view of the weather component (so far, just the inscription \\\"weather works!\\\").\\nLet's talk about the data that we expect to process in our application. \\nSuppose that we are dealing with a list of cities, and for each one a weather forecast is available. The forecast will include the following indicators:\\n* weather conditions;\\n* wind (speed and direction);\\n* temperature (for day and night).\\n\\nUsing these details, we can describe a new data type (let's call it the Forecast). We can use a special TypeScript feature - Interfaces (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) to do that. Just run the next command in the terminal to create the new interface:\\n\\n> **ng generate interface core/interfaces/forecast**\\n\\nAs you can see, with this command we have created the **./src/app/core/interfaces** directory and put the interface file *“forecast.ts”* inside. \\nNow we can describe our data type *“Forecast”* in it:\\n\\n```javascript\\nexport interface Forecast {\\n conditions: string;\\n wind: {\\n   speed: number;\\n   direction: string;\\n };\\n temperature: {\\n   day: {\\n     min: number;\\n     max: number;\\n   },\\n   night: {\\n     min: number;\\n     max: number;\\n   }\\n };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*Note: the \\\"export\\\" keyword allows us to import the declared interface later for using in components.*\\n\\nAs you can see, the interface is formally an object, which declares the data types of its keys instead of values. So, we have described the data structure of the weather forecast itself.\\n\\nAt this point, we would have finished describing our data if we had made a forecast for one city. But, since we are dealing with a list of cities, we need to describe the data type of the element of this list. To do this, create another interface (let's call it City):\\n\\n> **ng generate interface core/interfaces/city**\\n\\nThe city list element will include the name of the city and the forecast for it.\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { Forecast } from './forecast';\\n\\nexport interface City {\\n name: string;\\n forecast: Forecast;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*Note: here we can import and use the Forecast interface as it was marked with “export” keyword before.*\\n\\nNow that all the data types are described, we can start creating a component template.\\nThe markup of our page will have the following scheme:\\n![the-markup-of-our-page](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed-1.png)\\n\\nTo do this, create HTML markup and add styles to it:\\n\\n**weather.component.html**\\n``` javascript\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\">\\n <div class=\\\"page-header\\\">Weather Forecast</div>\\n <div class=\\\"page-body\\\">\\n   <!--Cities list will be here soon...-->\\n </div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\n**weather.component.scss**\\n``` javascript\\n.page {\\n width: 100%;\\n height: 100%;\\n padding: 20px;\\n\\n &-header {\\n   display: flex;\\n   justify-content: center;\\n   align-items: center;\\n   width: 100%;\\n   max-width: 1140px;\\n   height: 80px;\\n   margin: 0 auto;\\n   border-bottom: 2px solid #007fff;\\n   font-size: 36px;\\n   font-weight: 700;\\n   color: #0e63c7;\\n }\\n\\n &-body {\\n   display: flex;\\n\\n   width: 100%;\\n   max-width: 1140px;\\n   min-height: calc(100vh - 120px);\\n   margin: 0 auto;\\n\\n   &__sidebar {\\n     width: 300px;\\n     border-right: 2px solid #007fff;\\n   }\\n\\n   &__details {\\n     width: 100%;\\n   }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd we need to add some common styles to restore default browser properties. For these purposes, the Angular application has file src/styles.scss. Unlike styles written directly in the component, the styles described in this file have an effect on the entire project.\\n\\n**styles.scss**\\n``` javascript\\n* {\\n box-sizing: border-box;\\n}\\n\\nbody {\\n margin: 0;\\n}\\n\\na, a:hover, a:focus, a:active {\\n text-decoration: none;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNext, we need data in the format of a list of cities with their forecasts to be displayed in our application. In Angular, the data sources are special tools called Services. With the help of the following command, we will create a new service in **./src/app/core/services/** directory, and as it will return us the list of cities. Let's call it City:\\n\\n> **ng generate service core/services/city**\\n\\nThen add a method “getCities” to this service that will return a list of cities with forecasts in the form of an array.\\n\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\\n\\n@Injectable({\\n providedIn: 'root'\\n})\\nexport class CityService {\\n\\n getCities(): Array<City> {\\n\\n }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the majority of real Angular applications, the services receive data from some API, by interacting through HTTP requests. Working with HTTPS requests is not within the scope of this article and will be discussed later. At this time let’s just create a file **“./src/app/mocks/cities.mock.ts”** with test data that will be imported into our service.\\n\\n**cities.mock.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\\n\\nexport const CITIES: Array<City> = [\\n {\\n   name: 'New-York',\\n   forecast: {\\n     conditions: 'cloudy',\\n     wind: {\\n       speed: 6,\\n       direction: 'north-west'\\n     },\\n     temperature: {\\n       day: {\\n         min: 14,\\n         max: 18\\n       },\\n       night: {\\n         min: 5,\\n         max: 8\\n       }\\n     }\\n   }\\n },\\n {\\n   name: 'London',\\n   forecast: {\\n     conditions: 'rain',\\n     wind: {\\n       speed: 3,\\n       direction: 'east'\\n     },\\n     temperature: {\\n       day: {\\n         min: 11,\\n         max: 14\\n       },\\n       night: {\\n         min: 3,\\n         max: 7\\n       }\\n     }\\n   }\\n },\\n {\\n   name: 'Tokyo',\\n   forecast: {\\n     conditions: 'sunny',\\n     wind: {\\n       speed: 2,\\n       direction: 'south'\\n     },\\n     temperature: {\\n       day: {\\n         min: 22,\\n         max: 28\\n       },\\n       night: {\\n         min: 16,\\n         max: 19\\n       }\\n     }\\n   }\\n }\\n];\\n```\\n\\nNow we will modify our service so that the method “getCities” returns the test data from the created file:\\n\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\\n\\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\\nimport { CITIES } from '../../mocks/cities.mock'; // importing test data\\n\\n@Injectable({\\n providedIn: 'root'\\n})\\nexport class CityService {\\n\\n getCities(): Array<City> {\\n   return CITIES;  // method returns an array of cities\\n }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAn array of cities with their weather forecast is available in the service. But there is a question: how to access service methods from a component? To do that Angular provides a special mechanism so that any component can receive data from the source - the Dependency Injection (DI). With this mechanism, we can essentially create a relationship between the component variable and the service class. To implement this approach, let's modify our component as follows:\\n\\n**weather.component.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\\n\\n@Component({\\n selector: 'app-weather',\\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\\n})\\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\\n\\n cities: Array<City> = []; // create empty array of cities\\n\\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { } // inject CityService to private variable\\n\\n ngOnInit() {\\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities(); // on component initialize get data from service to local variable\\n }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExcellent! Now the data is available in the component. What remains is to bring data into the template. Angular has something to help us. It provides directives for controlling the display and the behavior of template elements. In this case, we will benefit from the **“NgFor” directive**, which allows displaying the elements of the iterable object in a loop, presenting them as DOM elements.\\nLet's display our array of cities in the form of an HTML list:\\n\\n**weather.component.html**\\n```javascript\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\">\\n <div class=\\\"page-header\\\">Weather Forecast</div>\\n <div class=\\\"page-body\\\">\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__sidebar\\\">\\n     <ul class=\\\"cities-list\\\"> <!--Added the list of cities-->  \\n       <li class=\\\"cities-list__item\\\" *ngFor=\\\"let city of cities\\\">\\n           {{ city.name }}\\n       </li>\\n     </ul>\\n   </div>\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__details\\\">\\n     <!--Forecast will be here soon...-->\\n   </div>\\n </div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nand add some styles to the end of weather.component.scss in order to beautify our list:\\n``` javascript\\n.cities-list {\\n width: 100%;\\n padding: 0;\\n margin: 0;\\n list-style: none;\\n\\n &__item {\\n   display: flex;\\n   justify-content: flex-start;\\n   align-items: center;\\n   font-size: 32px;\\n   color: #00a4ff;\\n   margin: 0;\\n   padding: 20px;\\n   width: 100%;\\n   min-height: 70px;\\n   border-bottom: 1px solid #e0dddd;\\n   transition: color .2s ease-out;\\n   cursor: pointer;\\n\\n   &:hover {\\n     color: #ff5b00;\\n   }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*Note: The method for the output of a component's class variable in its template is called “string interpolation”. The syntax involves placing the TypeScript code inside {{ }}, that we did by putting there the variable containing the string.*\\n\\nAfter applying the specified markup and styles, our application will take the following form:\\n![application-form](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed2.png)\\n\\nOk, now our application displays a list of cities, but their forecasts are hidden. The next goal is to show the forecast for the selected city. But before that, we should create a handler for choosing a city. It is logical that we will choose the city by clicking on it. So, let's add the functionality of city selection to our **weather.component.ts**:\\n\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\\n\\n@Component({\\n selector: 'app-weather',\\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\\n})\\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\\n\\n cities: Array<City> = [];\\n chosenCity; // create variable for saving current (chosen) city\\n\\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { }\\n\\n ngOnInit() {\\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities();\\n }\\n\\n onChooseCity(index: number): void { // create method, which will handle choose of the city\\n this.chosenCity = index;\\n}\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFrom the above code snippet, you can see that we have created a method for processing the city selection, which takes its index in the list of cities as a parameter and assigns it to the **variable “chosenCity”**. This method does not return anything when called, as indicated by the **type \\\"void\\\"** of the returned value.\\n\\nNext, we somehow need to link the click on the city name (if literally - to the HTML list element) with the method of the component class. For this, Angular has a feature for binding the component's template event to its class method. So alter the component template in the following way:\\n\\n**weather.component.html**\\n``` javascript\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\">\\n <div class=\\\"page-header\\\">Weather Forecast</div>\\n <div class=\\\"page-body\\\">\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__sidebar\\\">\\n     <ul class=\\\"cities-list\\\"> <!--Added the list of cities-->\\n       <li class=\\\"cities-list__item\\\"\\n         *ngFor=\\\"let city of cities; index as i\\\" <!--adding an element index to an array \\\"cities\\\"-->\\n         (click)=\\\"onChooseCity(i)\\\"> <!--binding an element clique to the method of the component class -->\\n           {{ city.name }}\\n       </li>\\n     </ul>\\n   </div>\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__details\\\">\\n     <!--Forecast will be here soon...-->\\n   </div>\\n </div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\n*Note: to avoid errors remember to remove comments from tag ```<li>```*\\n\\nWe can check whether our method works on list item click. To do this, simply add a line of code to the method that will output the parameter (in`ex) that the method receives to browser console.\\n``` javascript\\nonChooseCity(index: number): void {\\n console.log(index); // logging the index of the city in the browser console\\n this.chosenCity = index;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow, if everything was done correctly, by clicking on one of the cities we see its index in an array of cities in the browser console. Output to the console is a very common way to test the code at various stages of its execution. So, we have displayed a list of cities and created functionality for saving the index of the active city by clicking on it.\\n\\n## Step 3: Creating weather-details component\\n![step-3-creating-weather-details-component](/blog/content/images/2018/10/step-3.png)\\n\\nNow we can start developing a component for displaying the weather forecast for the selected city. As we did it before, we create a new component using the Angular CLI command:\\n\\n> **ng generate component weather/weather-details**\\n\\nAs we can see, within the directory of the weather component, the directory of the weather-details component with the necessary files was created. This structure warns the hierarchy of components - the weather-details component is a child relative to the weather component. Similarly, as we previously added the weather component to the app component, add the weather-details component to the weather component. To do this, in the weather component template, replace the ```“<!--Forecast will be here soon...-->\\\" ``` comment with the following line:\\n\\n```\\n<app-weather-details></app-weather-details>\\n```\\n\\nWe added one instance of weather-details' component, but we won't see it, because we did not choose some city. To hide and display the DOM elements, Angular provides a structural directive **```“*ngIf” ```**, which, depending on the truth of the condition transferred to it, displays or deletes the corresponding HTML element. Since earlier we implemented the index saving functionality of the selected city, now we can check it, and if it is *a number > -1* (indexes of cities start from 0) - to display the weather-details' component.\\n\\nSo, let's change the weather component template so that the **class \\\"visible\\\"** is assigned to the city’s weather-details component, providing that the given city is selected.\\n\\n``` javascript\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\">\\n <div class=\\\"page-header\\\">Weather Forecast</div>\\n <div class=\\\"page-body\\\">\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__sidebar\\\">\\n     <ul class=\\\"cities-list\\\"> <!--Added the list of cities-->\\n       <li class=\\\"cities-list__item\\\"\\n         *ngFor=\\\"let city of cities; index as i\\\"\\n         (click)=\\\"onChooseCity(i)\\\"> <!--binding an element clique to the method of the component class -->\\n           {{ city.name }}\\n       </li>\\n     </ul>\\n   </div>\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__details\\\">\\n    <app-weather-details *ngIf=\\\"chosenCity >= 0\\\"></app-weather-details>\\n   </div>\\n </div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nAfter compiling the code, our application will take the following form:\\n![application-take-the-following-form](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed3.png)\\n\\nBefore we move forward to develop a weather-details' component template, let's consider the transfer of data between components, since our next task is to pass the forecast of each city to its weather-details' component.\\n\\nIn Angular the data between the parent and the child component is transferred according to the next rules:\\n* *from parent to child* - using property binding;\\n* *from child to parent* - using event binding.\\n\\nIn the context of our application, we will use property binding only, as in our case the weather-details' component does not involve transferring any data to the parent weather component.\\n\\nThe method of binding properties, as its name suggests, involves binding the custom property of the child component with data that is supposed to be passed to it. On the other hand, the custom property must be declared in the class of the child component with the help of the ```**@Input()**``` decorator.\\n\\nIn the context of our application, it will look like this:\\n\\n**weather.component.html**\\n``` javascript\\n<app-weather-details\\n *ngIf=\\\"chosenCity >= 0\\\"\\n [forecast]=\\\"cities[chosenCity].forecast\\\">\\n</app-weather-details>\\n```\\n\\n**weather-details.component.ts**\\n``` javascript\\n@Input() forecast;\\n```\\n\\nThe *\\\"forecast\\\"* variable of the weather-details' component now contains the object with the weather forecast for the selected city. To give our application a more attractive look, let's connect the icons font with weather icons. \\nFor example, we will use Weather Icons (https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/), which are available as npm package. To use them, we have to install npm package with the command:\\n\\n> **npm install --save weather-icons-npm**\\n\\nThen we need to include the font to common styles of our project using CSS imports. To do this, insert the following line at the beginning of the **styles.scss**:\\n\\n``` javascript\\n@import '~weather-icons-npm/css/weather-icons.min.css';\\n```\\n\\nLet's edit the template and styles of the weather-details component to beautify the weather forecast display.\\n\\n**weather-details.component.html**\\n``` javascript\\n<div class=\\\"forecast\\\">\\n <div class=\\\"forecast-data\\\">\\n   <div class=\\\"forecast-row\\\">\\n     <span class=\\\"forecast-row__title\\\">Conditions: </span>\\n     <span class=\\\"forecast-row__description\\\">{{ forecast.conditions }}</span>\\n   </div>\\n   <div class=\\\"forecast-row\\\">\\n     <span class=\\\"forecast-row__title\\\">Temperature </span>\\n     <div class=\\\"forecast-subrow\\\">\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__title\\\">Day: </span>\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__description\\\">\\n        {{ forecast.temperature.day.min }}&#176; - {{ forecast.temperature.day.max }}&#176;C\\n      </span>\\n     </div>\\n     <div class=\\\"forecast-subrow\\\">\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__title\\\">Night: </span>\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__description\\\">\\n        {{ forecast.temperature.night.min }}&#176; - {{ forecast.temperature.night.max }}&#176;C\\n      </span>\\n     </div>\\n   </div>\\n   <div class=\\\"forecast-row\\\">\\n     <span class=\\\"forecast-row__title\\\">Wind </span>\\n     <div class=\\\"forecast-subrow\\\">\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__title\\\">Speed: </span>\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__description\\\">{{ forecast.wind.speed }}mps</span>\\n     </div>\\n     <div class=\\\"forecast-subrow\\\">\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__title\\\">Direction: </span>\\n       <span class=\\\"forecast-subrow__description\\\">{{ forecast.wind.direction }}</span>\\n     </div>\\n   </div>\\n </div>\\n <div class=\\\"forecast-logo\\\">\\n   <i class=\\\"wi wi-day-{{forecast.conditions}}\\\"></i>\\n </div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\n**weather-details.component.scss**\\n``` javascript\\n.forecast {\\n display: flex;\\n justify-content: space-between;\\n align-items: center;\\n width: 100%;\\n padding: 20px;\\n\\n &-data {\\n   width: 60%;\\n }\\n\\n &-row {\\n   margin-bottom: 10px;\\n\\n   &__title {\\n     font-size: 30px;\\n     color: #427188;\\n   }\\n\\n   &__description {\\n     font-size: 30px;\\n     color: #2196f3;\\n   }\\n }\\n\\n &-subrow {\\n   display: flex;\\n   justify-content: space-between;\\n   padding-left: 25px;\\n   margin-bottom: 10px;\\n\\n   &__title {\\n     font-size: 24px;\\n     color: #dc9833;\\n   }\\n\\n   &__description {\\n     font-size: 24px;\\n     color: #2196f3;\\n   }\\n }\\n\\n &-logo {\\n\\n   height: 100%;\\n   width: 40%;\\n   opacity: .4;\\n\\n   i {\\n     display: block;\\n     text-align: center;\\n     font-size: 120px;\\n   }\\n }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFinally, we got the next view of our application:\\n![Final-view-of-application](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed4.png)\\n\\nSo, after the performed manipulations, we got a simple Angular demo application that illustrates the basics of working with Angular CLI, TypeScript and Angular components. We examined the ways of interaction between the component class and its template, between the parent and the child components, and between the component and the Angular service. As you can see, studying Angular is not so complicated.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Read the 2nd part about developing weather forecast app: [here](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/creating-basic-angular-application-in-10-minutes-part-2/)</b>\\n\\nBut it is an interim stage of our app because we want to have the list of cities and weather forecast inside different blocks of the page. Our application will continue to evolve in the next article coming soon.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>During the last few years, a stable group of leaders was formed in the world of front-end frameworks. A lot was discussed and written about their strengths and weaknesses. Some frameworks are more productive, others are less, some are more complex, while others are easier to learn. This article is primarily focused on those who have some experience in web development, are familiar with JavaScript and are planning to study a new framework, but cannot decide which one to choose.</p>\n<p>Based on the available comparisons of popular frameworks, Angular is ideally suited for building large and medium-sized scalable mobile and web applications. At the same time, one of the shortcomings that’s often mentioned is the complexity of learning. To avoid this, consider an example of creating a simple Angular application to display the weather forecast.</p>\n<p>It should be mentioned that Angular uses TypeScript language. Do not worry if you have not worked with it before. In short, TypeScript is a typed JavaScript with some new features. There is extensive documentation available on the official website (<a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html\">https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html</a>), as well as many examples and tutorials on various web resources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step1preparingtheenvironment\">Step 1: Preparing the environment</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/step-1.png\" alt=\"step-1-preparing-the-environment\"></p>\n<p>The first thing you need for starting development is Node.js installed. The current version for your platform can be downloaded from the official site (<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download\">https://nodejs.org/en/download</a>). It comes with the Node Package Manager (NPM) which will also be installed. It’s required to load the project’s dependencies. To verify that the installation is successful, run the following commands:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>node -v<br>\nnpm -v</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You should receive the versions of the corresponding packages, that means the installation was successful and we can continue.<br>\nNext, you need to install global support of TypeScript language in your system. To do this, execute the next command in your terminal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>npm install -g typescript</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The flag -g (the short form from the --global) indicates that this package will be installed globally in the system (more information on the use of NPMs is available on the official website (<a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com\">https://docs.npmjs.com</a>) ).<br>\nIt is also necessary to install the Angular CLI globally (the command line interface from the Angular team, which greatly simplifies the application development process):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>npm install -g @angular/cli</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the installation of the mentioned packages is successfully completed, you can start creating the Angular application itself. To do this, you need to execute the following command in CLI inside the directory with your projects:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ng new weather-app --style scss</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: without flag --style [scss, stylus, less] CSS preprocessors will not be used by default for the project.</em></p>\n<p>This command generates a new Angular application with the specified name and using SASS as the default CSS preprocessor (more details about the Angular CLI commands can be found in the official documentation (<a href=\"https://cli.angular.io\">https://cli.angular.io</a>) ). As a result, a new project directory will be created with the base application template inside. To start the application, go to its directory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>cd weather-app</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and run the development server:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ng serve</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, visiting <a href=\"http://localhost:4200/\"><span style=\"color:green;\">http://localhost:4200/</span></a>, you should see the view of <strong>your first Angular application</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step2developingweathercomponent\">Step 2: Developing weather component</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/step-2.png\" alt=\"step-2-developing-weather-component\"></p>\n<p>Inside the project’s <strong>./src/app</strong> folder there is root component of the application - app.component located. It is still the only one in the project. One of the best practices is to take out a wrapper component outside the app.component. In our case, the wrapper component will be weather.component. Let's create it with the following Angular CLI command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ng generate component weather</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result, the directory of the new component “weather” is created in the folder <strong>./src/app</strong> with the following files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>weather.component.scss</em> - the component styles;</li>\n<li><em>weather.component.html</em> - the component view template;</li>\n<li><em>weather.component.spec.ts</em> - the component unit tests;</li>\n<li><em>weather.component.ts</em> - the component file itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s focus on Component decorator where the metadata of our component is indicated:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather',\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Selector is an identifier for the component usage in templates of other components, templateUrl and styleUrl are links to the template file and component styles. In addition, after component creation, Angular CLI declares it in the application module, which allows it to be used immediately in other components that are declared in this module.</p>\n<p><strong>app.module.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather/weather.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [\n   AppComponent,\n   WeatherComponent\n ],\n imports: [\n   BrowserModule\n ],\n providers: [],\n bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In other words, we can apply the weather component inside <em>the root component - app component</em>. So, let's organize our application this way - add weather component to the app component as its child. <strong>app.component.html</strong> should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;app-weather&gt;&lt;/app-weather&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>After saving the changes, the development server will refresh the page in the browser and you will see the view of the weather component (so far, just the inscription &quot;weather works!&quot;).<br>\nLet's talk about the data that we expect to process in our application.<br>\nSuppose that we are dealing with a list of cities, and for each one a weather forecast is available. The forecast will include the following indicators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>weather conditions;</li>\n<li>wind (speed and direction);</li>\n<li>temperature (for day and night).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using these details, we can describe a new data type (let's call it the Forecast). We can use a special TypeScript feature - Interfaces (<a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html\">https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html</a>) to do that. Just run the next command in the terminal to create the new interface:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ng generate interface core/interfaces/forecast</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, with this command we have created the <strong>./src/app/core/interfaces</strong> directory and put the interface file <em>“forecast.ts”</em> inside.<br>\nNow we can describe our data type <em>“Forecast”</em> in it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export interface Forecast {\n conditions: string;\n wind: {\n   speed: number;\n   direction: string;\n };\n temperature: {\n   day: {\n     min: number;\n     max: number;\n   },\n   night: {\n     min: number;\n     max: number;\n   }\n };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: the &quot;export&quot; keyword allows us to import the declared interface later for using in components.</em></p>\n<p>As you can see, the interface is formally an object, which declares the data types of its keys instead of values. So, we have described the data structure of the weather forecast itself.</p>\n<p>At this point, we would have finished describing our data if we had made a forecast for one city. But, since we are dealing with a list of cities, we need to describe the data type of the element of this list. To do this, create another interface (let's call it City):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ng generate interface core/interfaces/city</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The city list element will include the name of the city and the forecast for it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { Forecast } from './forecast';\n\nexport interface City {\n name: string;\n forecast: Forecast;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: here we can import and use the Forecast interface as it was marked with “export” keyword before.</em></p>\n<p>Now that all the data types are described, we can start creating a component template.<br>\nThe markup of our page will have the following scheme:<br>\n<img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed-1.png\" alt=\"the-markup-of-our-page\"></p>\n<p>To do this, create HTML markup and add styles to it:</p>\n<p><strong>weather.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;Weather Forecast&lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-body&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;!--Cities list will be here soon...--&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>weather.component.scss</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">.page {\n width: 100%;\n height: 100%;\n padding: 20px;\n\n &amp;-header {\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: center;\n   align-items: center;\n   width: 100%;\n   max-width: 1140px;\n   height: 80px;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n   border-bottom: 2px solid #007fff;\n   font-size: 36px;\n   font-weight: 700;\n   color: #0e63c7;\n }\n\n &amp;-body {\n   display: flex;\n\n   width: 100%;\n   max-width: 1140px;\n   min-height: calc(100vh - 120px);\n   margin: 0 auto;\n\n   &amp;__sidebar {\n     width: 300px;\n     border-right: 2px solid #007fff;\n   }\n\n   &amp;__details {\n     width: 100%;\n   }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we need to add some common styles to restore default browser properties. For these purposes, the Angular application has file src/styles.scss. Unlike styles written directly in the component, the styles described in this file have an effect on the entire project.</p>\n<p><strong>styles.scss</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">* {\n box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody {\n margin: 0;\n}\n\na, a:hover, a:focus, a:active {\n text-decoration: none;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we need data in the format of a list of cities with their forecasts to be displayed in our application. In Angular, the data sources are special tools called Services. With the help of the following command, we will create a new service in <strong>./src/app/core/services/</strong> directory, and as it will return us the list of cities. Let's call it City:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ng generate service core/services/city</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then add a method “getCities” to this service that will return a list of cities with forecasts in the form of an array.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\n\n@Injectable({\n providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class CityService {\n\n getCities(): Array&lt;City&gt; {\n\n }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the majority of real Angular applications, the services receive data from some API, by interacting through HTTP requests. Working with HTTPS requests is not within the scope of this article and will be discussed later. At this time let’s just create a file <strong>“./src/app/mocks/cities.mock.ts”</strong> with test data that will be imported into our service.</p>\n<p><strong>cities.mock.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\n\nexport const CITIES: Array&lt;City&gt; = [\n {\n   name: 'New-York',\n   forecast: {\n     conditions: 'cloudy',\n     wind: {\n       speed: 6,\n       direction: 'north-west'\n     },\n     temperature: {\n       day: {\n         min: 14,\n         max: 18\n       },\n       night: {\n         min: 5,\n         max: 8\n       }\n     }\n   }\n },\n {\n   name: 'London',\n   forecast: {\n     conditions: 'rain',\n     wind: {\n       speed: 3,\n       direction: 'east'\n     },\n     temperature: {\n       day: {\n         min: 11,\n         max: 14\n       },\n       night: {\n         min: 3,\n         max: 7\n       }\n     }\n   }\n },\n {\n   name: 'Tokyo',\n   forecast: {\n     conditions: 'sunny',\n     wind: {\n       speed: 2,\n       direction: 'south'\n     },\n     temperature: {\n       day: {\n         min: 22,\n         max: 28\n       },\n       night: {\n         min: 16,\n         max: 19\n       }\n     }\n   }\n }\n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we will modify our service so that the method “getCities” returns the test data from the created file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\nimport { CITIES } from '../../mocks/cities.mock'; // importing test data\n\n@Injectable({\n providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class CityService {\n\n getCities(): Array&lt;City&gt; {\n   return CITIES;  // method returns an array of cities\n }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>An array of cities with their weather forecast is available in the service. But there is a question: how to access service methods from a component? To do that Angular provides a special mechanism so that any component can receive data from the source - the Dependency Injection (DI). With this mechanism, we can essentially create a relationship between the component variable and the service class. To implement this approach, let's modify our component as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>weather.component.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\n\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather',\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\n\n cities: Array&lt;City&gt; = []; // create empty array of cities\n\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { } // inject CityService to private variable\n\n ngOnInit() {\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities(); // on component initialize get data from service to local variable\n }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Excellent! Now the data is available in the component. What remains is to bring data into the template. Angular has something to help us. It provides directives for controlling the display and the behavior of template elements. In this case, we will benefit from the <strong>“NgFor” directive</strong>, which allows displaying the elements of the iterable object in a loop, presenting them as DOM elements.<br>\nLet's display our array of cities in the form of an HTML list:</p>\n<p><strong>weather.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;Weather Forecast&lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-body&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;page-body__sidebar&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;ul class=&quot;cities-list&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Added the list of cities--&gt;  \n       &lt;li class=&quot;cities-list__item&quot; *ngFor=&quot;let city of cities&quot;&gt;\n           {{ city.name }}\n       &lt;/li&gt;\n     &lt;/ul&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;page-body__details&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;!--Forecast will be here soon...--&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and add some styles to the end of weather.component.scss in order to beautify our list:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">.cities-list {\n width: 100%;\n padding: 0;\n margin: 0;\n list-style: none;\n\n &amp;__item {\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: flex-start;\n   align-items: center;\n   font-size: 32px;\n   color: #00a4ff;\n   margin: 0;\n   padding: 20px;\n   width: 100%;\n   min-height: 70px;\n   border-bottom: 1px solid #e0dddd;\n   transition: color .2s ease-out;\n   cursor: pointer;\n\n   &amp;:hover {\n     color: #ff5b00;\n   }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: The method for the output of a component's class variable in its template is called “string interpolation”. The syntax involves placing the TypeScript code inside {{ }}, that we did by putting there the variable containing the string.</em></p>\n<p>After applying the specified markup and styles, our application will take the following form:<br>\n<img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed2.png\" alt=\"application-form\"></p>\n<p>Ok, now our application displays a list of cities, but their forecasts are hidden. The next goal is to show the forecast for the selected city. But before that, we should create a handler for choosing a city. It is logical that we will choose the city by clicking on it. So, let's add the functionality of city selection to our <strong>weather.component.ts</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\n\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather',\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\n\n cities: Array&lt;City&gt; = [];\n chosenCity; // create variable for saving current (chosen) city\n\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { }\n\n ngOnInit() {\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities();\n }\n\n onChooseCity(index: number): void { // create method, which will handle choose of the city\n this.chosenCity = index;\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>From the above code snippet, you can see that we have created a method for processing the city selection, which takes its index in the list of cities as a parameter and assigns it to the <strong>variable “chosenCity”</strong>. This method does not return anything when called, as indicated by the <strong>type &quot;void&quot;</strong> of the returned value.</p>\n<p>Next, we somehow need to link the click on the city name (if literally - to the HTML list element) with the method of the component class. For this, Angular has a feature for binding the component's template event to its class method. So alter the component template in the following way:</p>\n<p><strong>weather.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;Weather Forecast&lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-body&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;page-body__sidebar&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;ul class=&quot;cities-list&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Added the list of cities--&gt;\n       &lt;li class=&quot;cities-list__item&quot;\n         *ngFor=&quot;let city of cities; index as i&quot; &lt;!--adding an element index to an array &quot;cities&quot;--&gt;\n         (click)=&quot;onChooseCity(i)&quot;&gt; &lt;!--binding an element clique to the method of the component class --&gt;\n           {{ city.name }}\n       &lt;/li&gt;\n     &lt;/ul&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;page-body__details&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;!--Forecast will be here soon...--&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: to avoid errors remember to remove comments from tag <code>&lt;li&gt;</code></em></p>\n<p>We can check whether our method works on list item click. To do this, simply add a line of code to the method that will output the parameter (in`ex) that the method receives to browser console.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">onChooseCity(index: number): void {\n console.log(index); // logging the index of the city in the browser console\n this.chosenCity = index;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if everything was done correctly, by clicking on one of the cities we see its index in an array of cities in the browser console. Output to the console is a very common way to test the code at various stages of its execution. So, we have displayed a list of cities and created functionality for saving the index of the active city by clicking on it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step3creatingweatherdetailscomponent\">Step 3: Creating weather-details component</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/step-3.png\" alt=\"step-3-creating-weather-details-component\"></p>\n<p>Now we can start developing a component for displaying the weather forecast for the selected city. As we did it before, we create a new component using the Angular CLI command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ng generate component weather/weather-details</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can see, within the directory of the weather component, the directory of the weather-details component with the necessary files was created. This structure warns the hierarchy of components - the weather-details component is a child relative to the weather component. Similarly, as we previously added the weather component to the app component, add the weather-details component to the weather component. To do this, in the weather component template, replace the <code>“&lt;!--Forecast will be here soon...--&gt;&quot;</code> comment with the following line:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;app-weather-details&gt;&lt;/app-weather-details&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We added one instance of weather-details' component, but we won't see it, because we did not choose some city. To hide and display the DOM elements, Angular provides a structural directive <strong><code>“*ngIf”</code></strong>, which, depending on the truth of the condition transferred to it, displays or deletes the corresponding HTML element. Since earlier we implemented the index saving functionality of the selected city, now we can check it, and if it is <em>a number &gt; -1</em> (indexes of cities start from 0) - to display the weather-details' component.</p>\n<p>So, let's change the weather component template so that the <strong>class &quot;visible&quot;</strong> is assigned to the city’s weather-details component, providing that the given city is selected.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div class=&quot;page&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;Weather Forecast&lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;page-body&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;page-body__sidebar&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;ul class=&quot;cities-list&quot;&gt; &lt;!--Added the list of cities--&gt;\n       &lt;li class=&quot;cities-list__item&quot;\n         *ngFor=&quot;let city of cities; index as i&quot;\n         (click)=&quot;onChooseCity(i)&quot;&gt; &lt;!--binding an element clique to the method of the component class --&gt;\n           {{ city.name }}\n       &lt;/li&gt;\n     &lt;/ul&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;page-body__details&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;app-weather-details *ngIf=&quot;chosenCity &gt;= 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/app-weather-details&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>After compiling the code, our application will take the following form:<br>\n<img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed3.png\" alt=\"application-take-the-following-form\"></p>\n<p>Before we move forward to develop a weather-details' component template, let's consider the transfer of data between components, since our next task is to pass the forecast of each city to its weather-details' component.</p>\n<p>In Angular the data between the parent and the child component is transferred according to the next rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>from parent to child</em> - using property binding;</li>\n<li><em>from child to parent</em> - using event binding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the context of our application, we will use property binding only, as in our case the weather-details' component does not involve transferring any data to the parent weather component.</p>\n<p>The method of binding properties, as its name suggests, involves binding the custom property of the child component with data that is supposed to be passed to it. On the other hand, the custom property must be declared in the class of the child component with the help of the <code>**@Input()**</code> decorator.</p>\n<p>In the context of our application, it will look like this:</p>\n<p><strong>weather.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;app-weather-details\n *ngIf=&quot;chosenCity &gt;= 0&quot;\n [forecast]=&quot;cities[chosenCity].forecast&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/app-weather-details&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>weather-details.component.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">@Input() forecast;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <em>&quot;forecast&quot;</em> variable of the weather-details' component now contains the object with the weather forecast for the selected city. To give our application a more attractive look, let's connect the icons font with weather icons.<br>\nFor example, we will use Weather Icons (<a href=\"https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/\">https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/</a>), which are available as npm package. To use them, we have to install npm package with the command:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>npm install --save weather-icons-npm</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then we need to include the font to common styles of our project using CSS imports. To do this, insert the following line at the beginning of the <strong>styles.scss</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">@import '~weather-icons-npm/css/weather-icons.min.css';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's edit the template and styles of the weather-details component to beautify the weather forecast display.</p>\n<p><strong>weather-details.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div class=&quot;forecast&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-data&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-row&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-row__title&quot;&gt;Conditions: &lt;/span&gt;\n     &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-row__description&quot;&gt;{{ forecast.conditions }}&lt;/span&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-row&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-row__title&quot;&gt;Temperature &lt;/span&gt;\n     &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-subrow&quot;&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__title&quot;&gt;Day: &lt;/span&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__description&quot;&gt;\n        {{ forecast.temperature.day.min }}&amp;#176; - {{ forecast.temperature.day.max }}&amp;#176;C\n      &lt;/span&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-subrow&quot;&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__title&quot;&gt;Night: &lt;/span&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__description&quot;&gt;\n        {{ forecast.temperature.night.min }}&amp;#176; - {{ forecast.temperature.night.max }}&amp;#176;C\n      &lt;/span&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-row&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-row__title&quot;&gt;Wind &lt;/span&gt;\n     &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-subrow&quot;&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__title&quot;&gt;Speed: &lt;/span&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__description&quot;&gt;{{ forecast.wind.speed }}mps&lt;/span&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n     &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-subrow&quot;&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__title&quot;&gt;Direction: &lt;/span&gt;\n       &lt;span class=&quot;forecast-subrow__description&quot;&gt;{{ forecast.wind.direction }}&lt;/span&gt;\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;forecast-logo&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;i class=&quot;wi wi-day-{{forecast.conditions}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>weather-details.component.scss</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">.forecast {\n display: flex;\n justify-content: space-between;\n align-items: center;\n width: 100%;\n padding: 20px;\n\n &amp;-data {\n   width: 60%;\n }\n\n &amp;-row {\n   margin-bottom: 10px;\n\n   &amp;__title {\n     font-size: 30px;\n     color: #427188;\n   }\n\n   &amp;__description {\n     font-size: 30px;\n     color: #2196f3;\n   }\n }\n\n &amp;-subrow {\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: space-between;\n   padding-left: 25px;\n   margin-bottom: 10px;\n\n   &amp;__title {\n     font-size: 24px;\n     color: #dc9833;\n   }\n\n   &amp;__description {\n     font-size: 24px;\n     color: #2196f3;\n   }\n }\n\n &amp;-logo {\n\n   height: 100%;\n   width: 40%;\n   opacity: .4;\n\n   i {\n     display: block;\n     text-align: center;\n     font-size: 120px;\n   }\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, we got the next view of our application:<br>\n<img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed4.png\" alt=\"Final-view-of-application\"></p>\n<p>So, after the performed manipulations, we got a simple Angular demo application that illustrates the basics of working with Angular CLI, TypeScript and Angular components.

A lot was discussed and written about their strengths and\nweaknesses. Some frameworks are more productive, others are less, some are more\ncomplex, while others are easier to learn. This article is primarily focused on\nthose who have some experience in web development, are familiar with JavaScript\nand are planning to study a new framework, but cannot decide which one to\nchoose.\n\nBased on the available comparisons of popular frameworks, Angular is ideally\nsuited for building large and medium-sized scalable mobile and web applications.\nAt the same time, one of the shortcomings that’s often mentioned is the\ncomplexity of learning. To avoid this, consider an example of creating a simple\nAngular application to display the weather forecast.\n\nIt should be mentioned that Angular uses TypeScript language. Do not worry if\nyou have not worked with it before. In short, TypeScript is a typed JavaScript\nwith some new features. There is extensive documentation available on the\nofficial website (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html), as well as\nmany examples and tutorials on various web resources.\n\nStep 1: Preparing the environment\n\n\nThe first thing you need for starting development is Node.js installed. The\ncurrent version for your platform can be downloaded from the official site (\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/download). It comes with the Node Package Manager (NPM)\nwhich will also be installed. It’s required to load the project’s dependencies.\nTo verify that the installation is successful, run the following commands:\n\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n\nYou should receive the versions of the corresponding packages, that means the\ninstallation was successful and we can continue.\nNext, you need to install global support of TypeScript language in your system.\nTo do this, execute the next command in your terminal:\n\nnpm install -g typescript\n\nThe flag -g (the short form from the --global) indicates that this package will\nbe installed globally in the system (more information on the use of NPMs is\navailable on the official website (https://docs.npmjs.com) ).\nIt is also necessary to install the Angular CLI globally (the command line\ninterface from the Angular team, which greatly simplifies the application\ndevelopment process):\n\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\n\nAfter the installation of the mentioned packages is successfully completed, you\ncan start creating the Angular application itself. To do this, you need to\nexecute the following command in CLI inside the directory with your projects:\n\nng new weather-app --style scss\n\nNote: without flag --style [scss, stylus, less] CSS preprocessors will not be\nused by default for the project.\n\nThis command generates a new Angular application with the specified name and\nusing SASS as the default CSS preprocessor (more details about the Angular CLI\ncommands can be found in the official documentation (https://cli.angular.io) ).\nAs a result, a new project directory will be created with the base application\ntemplate inside. To start the application, go to its directory:\n\ncd weather-app\n\nand run the development server:\n\nng serve\n\nNow, visiting http://localhost:4200/, you should see the view of your first\nAngular application.\n\nStep 2: Developing weather component\n\n\nInside the project’s ./src/app  folder there is root component of the\napplication - app.component located. It is still the only one in the project.\nOne of the best practices is to take out a wrapper component outside the\napp.component. In our case, the wrapper component will be weather.component.\nLet's create it with the following Angular CLI command:\n\nng generate component weather\n\nAs a result, the directory of the new component “weather” is created in the\nfolder ./src/app  with the following files:\n\n * weather.component.scss  - the component styles;\n * weather.component.html  - the component view template;\n * weather.component.spec.ts  - the component unit tests;\n * weather.component.ts  - the component file itself.\n\nLet’s focus on Component decorator where the metadata of our component is\nindicated:\n\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather',\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\n})\n\n\nSelector is an identifier for the component usage in templates of other\ncomponents, templateUrl and styleUrl are links to the template file and\ncomponent styles. In addition, after component creation, Angular CLI declares it\nin the application module, which allows it to be used immediately in other\ncomponents that are declared in this module.\n\napp.module.ts\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather/weather.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [\n   AppComponent,\n   WeatherComponent\n ],\n imports: [\n   BrowserModule\n ],\n providers: [],\n bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n\nIn other words, we can apply the weather component inside the root component -\napp component. So, let's organize our application this way - add weather\ncomponent to the app component as its child. app.component.html  should look\nlike this:\n\n<app-weather></app-weather>\n\n\nAfter saving the changes, the development server will refresh the page in the\nbrowser and you will see the view of the weather component (so far, just the\ninscription \"weather works!\").\nLet's talk about the data that we expect to process in our application.\nSuppose that we are dealing with a list of cities, and for each one a weather\nforecast is available. The forecast will include the following indicators:\n\n * weather conditions;\n * wind (speed and direction);\n * temperature (for day and night).\n\nUsing these details, we can describe a new data type (let's call it the\nForecast). We can use a special TypeScript feature - Interfaces (\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) to do that. Just\nrun the next command in the terminal to create the new interface:\n\nng generate interface core/interfaces/forecast\n\nAs you can see, with this command we have created the ./src/app/core/interfaces \ndirectory and put the interface file “forecast.ts”  inside.\nNow we can describe our data type “Forecast”  in it:\n\nexport interface Forecast {\n conditions: string;\n wind: {\n   speed: number;\n   direction: string;\n };\n temperature: {\n   day: {\n     min: number;\n     max: number;\n   },\n   night: {\n     min: number;\n     max: number;\n   }\n };\n}\n\n\nNote: the \"export\" keyword allows us to import the declared interface later for\nusing in components.\n\nAs you can see, the interface is formally an object, which declares the data\ntypes of its keys instead of values. So, we have described the data structure of\nthe weather forecast itself.\n\nAt this point, we would have finished describing our data if we had made a\nforecast for one city. But, since we are dealing with a list of cities, we need\nto describe the data type of the element of this list. To do this, create\nanother interface (let's call it City):\n\nng generate interface core/interfaces/city\n\nThe city list element will include the name of the city and the forecast for it.\n\nimport { Forecast } from './forecast';\n\nexport interface City {\n name: string;\n forecast: Forecast;\n}\n\n\nNote: here we can import and use the Forecast interface as it was marked with\n“export” keyword before.\n\nNow that all the data types are described, we can start creating a component\ntemplate.\nThe markup of our page will have the following scheme:\n\n\nTo do this, create HTML markup and add styles to it:\n\nweather.component.html\n\n<div class=\"page\">\n <div class=\"page-header\">Weather Forecast</div>\n <div class=\"page-body\">\n   <!--Cities list will be here soon...-->\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\nweather.component.scss\n\n.page {\n width: 100%;\n height: 100%;\n padding: 20px;\n\n &-header {\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: center;\n   align-items: center;\n   width: 100%;\n   max-width: 1140px;\n   height: 80px;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n   border-bottom: 2px solid #007fff;\n   font-size: 36px;\n   font-weight: 700;\n   color: #0e63c7;\n }\n\n &-body {\n   display: flex;\n\n   width: 100%;\n   max-width: 1140px;\n   min-height: calc(100vh - 120px);\n   margin: 0 auto;\n\n   &__sidebar {\n     width: 300px;\n     border-right: 2px solid #007fff;\n   }\n\n   &__details {\n     width: 100%;\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\nAnd we need to add some common styles to restore default browser properties. For\nthese purposes, the Angular application has file src/styles.scss. Unlike styles\nwritten directly in the component, the styles described in this file have an\neffect on the entire project.\n\nstyles.scss\n\n* {\n box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\nbody {\n margin: 0;\n}\n\na, a:hover, a:focus, a:active {\n text-decoration: none;\n}\n\n\nNext, we need data in the format of a list of cities with their forecasts to be\ndisplayed in our application. In Angular, the data sources are special tools\ncalled Services. With the help of the following command, we will create a new\nservice in ./src/app/core/services/  directory, and as it will return us the\nlist of cities. Let's call it City:\n\nng generate service core/services/city\n\nThen add a method “getCities” to this service that will return a list of cities\nwith forecasts in the form of an array.\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\n\n@Injectable({\n providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class CityService {\n\n getCities(): Array<City> {\n\n }\n\n}\n\n\nIn the majority of real Angular applications, the services receive data from\nsome API, by interacting through HTTP requests. Working with HTTPS requests is\nnot within the scope of this article and will be discussed later. At this time\nlet’s just create a file “./src/app/mocks/cities.mock.ts”  with test data that\nwill be imported into our service.\n\ncities.mock.ts\n\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\n\nexport const CITIES: Array<City> = [\n {\n   name: 'New-York',\n   forecast: {\n     conditions: 'cloudy',\n     wind: {\n       speed: 6,\n       direction: 'north-west'\n     },\n     temperature: {\n       day: {\n         min: 14,\n         max: 18\n       },\n       night: {\n         min: 5,\n         max: 8\n       }\n     }\n   }\n },\n {\n   name: 'London',\n   forecast: {\n     conditions: 'rain',\n     wind: {\n       speed: 3,\n       direction: 'east'\n     },\n     temperature: {\n       day: {\n         min: 11,\n         max: 14\n       },\n       night: {\n         min: 3,\n         max: 7\n       }\n     }\n   }\n },\n {\n   name: 'Tokyo',\n   forecast: {\n     conditions: 'sunny',\n     wind: {\n       speed: 2,\n       direction: 'south'\n     },\n     temperature: {\n       day: {\n         min: 22,\n         max: 28\n       },\n       night: {\n         min: 16,\n         max: 19\n       }\n     }\n   }\n }\n];\n\n\nNow we will modify our service so that the method “getCities” returns the test\ndata from the created file:\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\nimport { CITIES } from '../../mocks/cities.mock'; // importing test data\n\n@Injectable({\n providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class CityService {\n\n getCities(): Array<City> {\n   return CITIES;  // method returns an array of cities\n }\n\n}\n\n\nAn array of cities with their weather forecast is available in the service. But\nthere is a question: how to access service methods from a component? To do that\nAngular provides a special mechanism so that any component can receive data from\nthe source - the Dependency Injection (DI). With this mechanism, we can\nessentially create a relationship between the component variable and the service\nclass. To implement this approach, let's modify our component as follows:\n\nweather.component.ts\n\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\n\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather',\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\n\n cities: Array<City> = []; // create empty array of cities\n\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { } // inject CityService to private variable\n\n ngOnInit() {\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities(); // on component initialize get data from service to local variable\n }\n\n}\n\n\nExcellent! Now the data is available in the component. What remains is to bring\ndata into the template. Angular has something to help us. It provides directives\nfor controlling the display and the behavior of template elements. In this case,\nwe will benefit from the “NgFor” directive, which allows displaying the elements\nof the iterable object in a loop, presenting them as DOM elements.\nLet's display our array of cities in the form of an HTML list:\n\nweather.component.html\n\n<div class=\"page\">\n <div class=\"page-header\">Weather Forecast</div>\n <div class=\"page-body\">\n   <div class=\"page-body__sidebar\">\n     <ul class=\"cities-list\"> <!--Added the list of cities-->  \n       <li class=\"cities-list__item\" *ngFor=\"let city of cities\">\n           {{ city.name }}\n       </li>\n     </ul>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"page-body__details\">\n     <!--Forecast will be here soon...-->\n   </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\nand add some styles to the end of weather.component.scss in order to beautify\nour list:\n\n.cities-list {\n width: 100%;\n padding: 0;\n margin: 0;\n list-style: none;\n\n &__item {\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: flex-start;\n   align-items: center;\n   font-size: 32px;\n   color: #00a4ff;\n   margin: 0;\n   padding: 20px;\n   width: 100%;\n   min-height: 70px;\n   border-bottom: 1px solid #e0dddd;\n   transition: color .2s ease-out;\n   cursor: pointer;\n\n   &:hover {\n     color: #ff5b00;\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\nNote: The method for the output of a component's class variable in its template\nis called “string interpolation”. The syntax involves placing the TypeScript\ncode inside {{ }}, that we did by putting there the variable containing the\nstring.\n\nAfter applying the specified markup and styles, our application will take the\nfollowing form:\n\n\nOk, now our application displays a list of cities, but their forecasts are\nhidden. The next goal is to show the forecast for the selected city. But before\nthat, we should create a handler for choosing a city. It is logical that we will\nchoose the city by clicking on it. So, let's add the functionality of city\nselection to our weather.component.ts:\n\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\n\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather',\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\n\n cities: Array<City> = [];\n chosenCity; // create variable for saving current (chosen) city\n\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { }\n\n ngOnInit() {\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities();\n }\n\n onChooseCity(index: number): void { // create method, which will handle choose of the city\n this.chosenCity = index;\n}\n\n}\n\n\nFrom the above code snippet, you can see that we have created a method for\nprocessing the city selection, which takes its index in the list of cities as a\nparameter and assigns it to the variable “chosenCity”. This method does not\nreturn anything when called, as indicated by the type \"void\"  of the returned\nvalue.\n\nNext, we somehow need to link the click on the city name (if literally - to the\nHTML list element) with the method of the component class. For this, Angular has\na feature for binding the component's template event to its class method. So\nalter the component template in the following way:\n\nweather.component.html\n\n<div class=\"page\">\n <div class=\"page-header\">Weather Forecast</div>\n <div class=\"page-body\">\n   <div class=\"page-body__sidebar\">\n     <ul class=\"cities-list\"> <!--Added the list of cities-->\n       <li class=\"cities-list__item\"\n         *ngFor=\"let city of cities; index as i\" <!--adding an element index to an array \"cities\"-->\n         (click)=\"onChooseCity(i)\"> <!--binding an element clique to the method of the component class -->\n           {{ city.name }}\n       </li>\n     </ul>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"page-body__details\">\n     <!--Forecast will be here soon...-->\n   </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\nNote: to avoid errors remember to remove comments from tag <li>\n\nWe can check whether our method works on list item click. To do this, simply add\na line of code to the method that will output the parameter (in`ex) that the\nmethod receives to browser console.\n\nonChooseCity(index: number): void {\n console.log(index); // logging the index of the city in the browser console\n this.chosenCity = index;\n}\n\n\nNow, if everything was done correctly, by clicking on one of the cities we see\nits index in an array of cities in the browser console. Output to the console is\na very common way to test the code at various stages of its execution. So, we\nhave displayed a list of cities and created functionality for saving the index\nof the active city by clicking on it.\n\nStep 3: Creating weather-details component\n\n\nNow we can start developing a component for displaying the weather forecast for\nthe selected city. As we did it before, we create a new component using the\nAngular CLI command:\n\nng generate component weather/weather-details\n\nAs we can see, within the directory of the weather component, the directory of\nthe weather-details component with the necessary files was created. This\nstructure warns the hierarchy of components - the weather-details component is a\nchild relative to the weather component. Similarly, as we previously added the\nweather component to the app component, add the weather-details component to the\nweather component. To do this, in the weather component template, replace the \n“<!--Forecast will be here soon...-->\"  comment with the following line:\n\n<app-weather-details></app-weather-details>\n\n\nWe added one instance of weather-details' component, but we won't see it,\nbecause we did not choose some city. To hide and display the DOM elements,\nAngular provides a structural directive “*ngIf”, which, depending on the truth\nof the condition transferred to it, displays or deletes the corresponding HTML\nelement. Since earlier we implemented the index saving functionality of the\nselected city, now we can check it, and if it is a number > -1  (indexes of\ncities start from 0) - to display the weather-details' component.\n\nSo, let's change the weather component template so that the class \"visible\"  is\nassigned to the city’s weather-details component, providing that the given city\nis selected.\n\n<div class=\"page\">\n <div class=\"page-header\">Weather Forecast</div>\n <div class=\"page-body\">\n   <div class=\"page-body__sidebar\">\n     <ul class=\"cities-list\"> <!--Added the list of cities-->\n       <li class=\"cities-list__item\"\n         *ngFor=\"let city of cities; index as i\"\n         (click)=\"onChooseCity(i)\"> <!--binding an element clique to the method of the component class -->\n           {{ city.name }}\n       </li>\n     </ul>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"page-body__details\">\n    <app-weather-details *ngIf=\"chosenCity >= 0\"></app-weather-details>\n   </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\nAfter compiling the code, our application will take the following form:\n\n\nBefore we move forward to develop a weather-details' component template, let's\nconsider the transfer of data between components, since our next task is to pass\nthe forecast of each city to its weather-details' component.\n\nIn Angular the data between the parent and the child component is transferred\naccording to the next rules:\n\n * from parent to child  - using property binding;\n * from child to parent  - using event binding.\n\nIn the context of our application, we will use property binding only, as in our\ncase the weather-details' component does not involve transferring any data to\nthe parent weather component.\n\nThe method of binding properties, as its name suggests, involves binding the\ncustom property of the child component with data that is supposed to be passed\nto it. On the other hand, the custom property must be declared in the class of\nthe child component with the help of the **@Input()**  decorator.\n\nIn the context of our application, it will look like this:\n\nweather.component.html\n\n<app-weather-details\n *ngIf=\"chosenCity >= 0\"\n [forecast]=\"cities[chosenCity].forecast\">\n</app-weather-details>\n\n\nweather-details.component.ts\n\n@Input() forecast;\n\n\nThe \"forecast\"  variable of the weather-details' component now contains the\nobject with the weather forecast for the selected city. To give our application\na more attractive look, let's connect the icons font with weather icons.\nFor example, we will use Weather Icons (\nhttps://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/), which are available as npm\npackage. To use them, we have to install npm package with the command:\n\nnpm install --save weather-icons-npm\n\nThen we need to include the font to common styles of our project using CSS\nimports. To do this, insert the following line at the beginning of the \nstyles.scss:\n\n@import '~weather-icons-npm/css/weather-icons.min.css';\n\n\nLet's edit the template and styles of the weather-details component to beautify\nthe weather forecast display.\n\nweather-details.component.html\n\n<div class=\"forecast\">\n <div class=\"forecast-data\">\n   <div class=\"forecast-row\">\n     <span class=\"forecast-row__title\">Conditions: </span>\n     <span class=\"forecast-row__description\">{{ forecast.conditions }}</span>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"forecast-row\">\n     <span class=\"forecast-row__title\">Temperature </span>\n     <div class=\"forecast-subrow\">\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__title\">Day: </span>\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__description\">\n        {{ forecast.temperature.day.min }}&#176; - {{ forecast.temperature.day.max }}&#176;C\n      </span>\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"forecast-subrow\">\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__title\">Night: </span>\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__description\">\n        {{ forecast.temperature.night.min }}&#176; - {{ forecast.temperature.night.max }}&#176;C\n      </span>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"forecast-row\">\n     <span class=\"forecast-row__title\">Wind </span>\n     <div class=\"forecast-subrow\">\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__title\">Speed: </span>\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__description\">{{ forecast.wind.speed }}mps</span>\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"forecast-subrow\">\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__title\">Direction: </span>\n       <span class=\"forecast-subrow__description\">{{ forecast.wind.direction }}</span>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"forecast-logo\">\n   <i class=\"wi wi-day-{{forecast.conditions}}\"></i>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\nweather-details.component.scss\n\n.forecast {\n display: flex;\n justify-content: space-between;\n align-items: center;\n width: 100%;\n padding: 20px;\n\n &-data {\n   width: 60%;\n }\n\n &-row {\n   margin-bottom: 10px;\n\n   &__title {\n     font-size: 30px;\n     color: #427188;\n   }\n\n   &__description {\n     font-size: 30px;\n     color: #2196f3;\n   }\n }\n\n &-subrow {\n   display: flex;\n   justify-content: space-between;\n   padding-left: 25px;\n   margin-bottom: 10px;\n\n   &__title {\n     font-size: 24px;\n     color: #dc9833;\n   }\n\n   &__description {\n     font-size: 24px;\n     color: #2196f3;\n   }\n }\n\n &-logo {\n\n   height: 100%;\n   width: 40%;\n   opacity: .4;\n\n   i {\n     display: block;\n     text-align: center;\n     font-size: 120px;\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\nFinally, we got the next view of our application:\n\n\nSo, after the performed manipulations, we got a simple Angular demo application\nthat illustrates the basics of working with Angular CLI, TypeScript and Angular\ncomponents. We examined the ways of interaction between the component class and\nits template, between the parent and the child components, and between the\ncomponent and the Angular service. As you can see, studying Angular is not so\ncomplicated.\n\nRead the 2nd part about developing weather forecast app: here\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/creating-basic-angular-application-in-10-minutes-part-2/]\n\nBut it is an interim stage of our app because we want to have the list of cities\nand weather forecast inside different blocks of the page.

Here you find top 9 steps from the abstract idea of to the practical implementation. It doesn’t matter whether it’s developed for iOS, Android or Web, this plan is useful for every developer. \\n\\nThis infographic leads you from “the bottom stage” to “the upper stage” of your project.\\n\\n![inforapic-top-9-steps-for-the-application-development](/blog/content/images/2018/10/inforapic3.jpg)\\n\\nThe steps of the app development were described in general terms. \\n\\n**Now each of the 9 steps, its goal and necessity will be described more precisely.**\\n\\n## 1. Write down the purpose and ideas of an app.\\n\\nThe abstract idea must turn into the exact goal. In what way is your iOS or Android application helpful for users? It should solve some problems and simplify the life of users or serve for entertainment. \\n\\nWrite down your ideas concerning generating money from your app. Either it’s offered for free (then you can earn money with ads appearing in the application) or paid. Each feature must be described exactly.\\n\\n## 2. Market survey and target audience \\nMaybe you think that your idea is unique. But something similar has ever appeared already. That’s why it’s important to make a research of apps existing in the market. Analyze applications similar to yours, and after carrying out the competition analysis you should decide upon advantages and disadvantages of the competitors.\\n\\nFor the successful app design and development, you should make the portrait of the average user interested in the app. The ads for older women and for teens has to be different so let’s decide what your target audience is. After you have defined these target users, try to look through their eyes. What do they want? What sources must they learn about your app from? That would be a plus to describe your app creation idea to some of these users and to ask if it’s interesting for them, what they wish to see in the app and what seems boring.\\n\\n## 3. Making a wireframe\\n![makinga-wireframe](/blog/content/images/2018/10/makinga-wireframe.jpg)\\n\\nThe wireframe is a basely detailed presentation of the app design. With help of wireframes, you can clarify the future look of your app both for yourself and for developers.

Decide upon the back end\\n\\nAfter having created skins you have clarified the app design expectations and plans about the functionality of the app. But the application needs the back end, so decide if you create it yourself (for that you need to decide upon your servers, to develop APIs yourself) or if you don’t understand much of how it functions, use a service offering you back-end development and hosting. \\n\\nThese services can help you:\\n* <a href=\\\"https://www.parse.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https://www.parse.com/</a>\\n* <a href=\\\"http://www.applicasa.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http://www.applicasa.com/</a>\\n* <a href=\\\"http://www.kinvey.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http://www.kinvey.com/</a>\\n\\n## 6.

In this way your application should be brought to the market.\\n\\n## 7. Testing and improving\\n\\nNow when the demo version is ready, you should let the friends and acquaintance test your application. Especially pay attention to the opinion of those friends who belong to the target audience. Ask them what they like and don’t like about this app idea development. What do they want to change? Is the navigation comfortable for them? What colors do they prefer and what seems strange to them? Be ready for the criticism and improve your app design. \\n\\nTake the feedback into account and improve your app. When you think everything is OK about this app, you should start with beta testing. You need to examine the final layers, interactions, and design (these platforms can help you: Proto.io and Pixate)\\n\\nThe same team or target audience which has tested your product for the first time helps again and should evaluate the changes. Ask them if the application has become better if their concerns were taken into account. Of course, the bugs have to be removed and the app design sometimes has to be modified again.\\n\\n## 8.

You have tested and improved the app many times and it’s time to release. The way from the idea to the full product is travelled! But you should know some peculiarities of the operating systems.\\n\\nConcerning the way of coming to the market, Android and iOS are different. If you make an Android application, you can just add it to the android store. The same thing is with the Google Play store. But iOS is more strictly. If you publish the app on iOS, the iOS team has to review your app before release, so you have to wait a couple of days.\\n\\n## 9. Upgrade and new materials\\n\\nTo release the app and to think that you’ll become rich instantly would be strange. Other new apps appear very quickly so you should keep the users interested in your app. Prepare yourself for making updates and creating new content.\\n\\nUse the feedback and analytics to understand the behavior and interests of users.

We created two components - the weather component and the weather-details component. We received weather data from the mock file and provided it through the service to the weather component, and further into the weather-details component of each city. Then, by clicking on one of the cities we displayed corresponding weather-details component.\\n\\nFinally, our application looked like this:\\n![final-look-of-our-angular-app](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed1.png)\\n\\nIt can be assumed that we are not satisfied with this application template. Now we want to have the list of cities and weather forecast inside different blocks of the page. Let's go further: suppose that our application will continue to evolve, and other functions will appear beside the weather forecast - for example, displaying of news, exchanging rates, etc. The most intuitive interface, in this case, will be a classic layout with a sidebar containing links on the left side and the main content on the right side. The sidebar will always be present on the screen and only the part with the main content will change.\\n\\n## Adding routing to the application\\n![adding-routing-to-the-application](/blog/content/images/2018/10/adding-routing.png)\\n\\nSo we have got close to the use of routing in Angular. And the layout described above in single-page applications is realized with its help. \\n\\nFirst, let's imagine the **new structure** of our application:\\n![new-structure-of-our-application](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed2-1.png)\\n\\nWe have modify the layout of the weather component and remove template binding to the weather-details component. Instead, we will create a routing node using Angular features.\\n\\n**weather.component.html**\\n``` javascript\\n...\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__details\\\">\\n     <!--Router will be here soon-->\\n   </div>\\n...\\n```\\n\\nSo, let's start reorganizing our application using Angular routing. The best practice is to create separate modules for routing functionality. \\n\\nThe first thing to do in the root component template is to specify the location where the corresponding components will be rendered when navigating to the particular route. \\n\\nAngular provides a special tag to do this - **`<router-outlet>`**. In our case, the root component template will look like this:\\n\\n**app.component.html**\\n```\\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\\n```\\n\\nThe best practice is to create separate modules for routing functionality. Therefore, we will create a root routing module - **an app-routing.module.**\\n\\n``` javascript\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\\n\\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\\n { path: 'weather', loadChildren: './weather/weather.module#WeatherModule' },\\n { path: '', redirectTo: 'weather', pathMatch: 'full' }\\n];\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes) ],\\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\\n})\\nexport class AppRoutingModule { }\\n```\\n\\nHere we defined the constant appRoutes, which is an array of routes that describes the routing scheme relative to the application root. Namely, we will have one \\\"weather\\\" route, according to which the weather component will be rendered in place of the router-outlet component. We also determined that when you go to an empty route, you will be redirected to the \\\"weather\\\" route. \\n\\n*Note: here we use the feature of Angular routing - lazy-loading modules. This technology allows the builder (Webpack, etc.) to allocate lazy loadable modules with separate files, which are downloaded by the browser only in case of switching over the corresponding routing.*\\n\\nNext, we import the Router Module and configure it, passing our array with routes to its **\\\"forRoot\\\" method**. Finally, we export the configured **Router Module**.\\n\\nNow modify the root module of the application:\\n``` javascript\\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\n\\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n declarations: [ AppComponent ],\\n imports: [\\n   BrowserModule,\\n   AppRoutingModule\\n ],\\n providers: [],\\n bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]\\n})\\nexport class AppModule { }\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, we no longer import and declare the weather and weather-details components in the app module. Instead, we import **app-routing module.** It should be mentioned that the weather and weather-details components will be declared in their own modules, that we will create later. \\n*Note: do not forget to delete weather and weather-details components declaration in app module.*\\n\\nThe mechanism of lazy loading modules by its definition involves loading the module, which declares the corresponding component. In addition, if a module is a routing node, it must have its own routing module. \\nNext, we will **create weather and weather-routing modules**:\\n\\n**weather-routing.module.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\\n\\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather.component';\\n\\nconst weatherRoutes: Routes = [\\n { path: '', component: WeatherComponent }\\n];\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n imports: [ RouterModule.forChild(weatherRoutes) ],\\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\\n})\\nexport class WeatherRoutingModule { }\\n```\\n\\n**weather.module.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\\n\\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather.component';\\nimport { WeatherRoutingModule } from './weather-routing.module';\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n declarations: [ WeatherComponent ],\\n imports: [\\n   CommonModule,\\n   WeatherRoutingModule\\n ]\\n})\\nexport class WeatherModule { }\\n```\\n\\nIn the same way, as we did earlier, we create a routing configuration for the weather node and store it in the **weatherRoutes array**. We import the **Router Module** again and configure it, but using **\\\"forChild\\\" method**, since our node is not the root.\\n\\nWeather module was indicated as a lazy-loadable module above. So it is loaded when the user is going to the “weather” route. Here we declared the weather component, imported the routing module and the common module necessary for using a number of Angular common directives (such as ngIf, ngFor, ngClass, etc.) in the component template.\\n\\nIf everything was done correctly, after compilation, we will not see any changes in the appearance of our application, as in fact we just changed its architecture.\\n\\nIt would be logical to assume that when clicking on one of the cities we should go to the **\\\"weather/detail/<city_id>\\\"** route and display the weather forecast for the selected city with the weather-details component on the right side of our application. \\nSo, let's add the router-outlet to the place where the forecast will be rendered.\\n\\n**weather.component.html**\\n``` javascript\\n...\\n<div class=\\\"page-body__details\\\">\\n <router-outlet></router-outlet>\\n</div>\\n...\\n```\\n\\nNext, **create a module for the weather-details component**, as well as the routing module for it.\\n\\n**weather-details-routing.module.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\\n\\nimport { WeatherDetailsComponent } from './weather-details.component';\\n\\nconst weatherDetailsRoutes: Routes = [\\n { path: '', component: WeatherDetailsComponent }\\n];\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n imports: [ RouterModule.forChild(weatherDetailsRoutes) ],\\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\\n})\\nexport class WeatherDetailsRoutingModule { }\\n```\\n\\n**weather-details.module.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\\n\\nimport { WeatherDetailsComponent } from './weather-details.component';\\nimport { WeatherDetailsRoutingModule } from './weather-details-routing.module';\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n declarations: [ WeatherDetailsComponent ],\\n imports: [\\n   CommonModule,\\n   WeatherDetailsRoutingModule\\n ]\\n})\\nexport class WeatherDetailsModule { }\\n```\\n\\nSimilarly, with the weather component, we prepared the **weather-details component** for inclusion in our routing system, as a lazily-loaded module. Earlier we dealt with the child components, and now we will analyze the notion of child routes. Since the weather-details component remains in the application hierarchy as a child relative to the weather component, we will represent the route for it as a child to the \\\"weather\\\" route. \\nTo do this, we change the configuration of the weather component routing.\\n\\n``` javascript\\nconst weatherRoutes: Routes = [\\n { path: '',\\n   component: WeatherComponent,\\n   children: [\\n     { path: 'details/:id', loadChildren: './weather-details/weather-details.module#WeatherDetailsModule' }\\n   ]\\n }\\n];\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, we added a child route to the already existing \\\"weather\\\" route. Also, in the configuration of the routing, we indicated the mandatory parameter of the city ID. \\nAs a result, for the output of the forecast, we need to go to the URL like **\\\"weather/details/2\\\".**\\n\\n## Changing data types and the service to work with them\\n![changing-data-types-and-the-service-to-work-with-them](/blog/content/images/2018/10/changing-data-types.png)\\n\\nGo to the **weather-details component.** At the moment, it involves retrieving from the parent component an object with a weather forecast to display it. Now we will go the other way: the weather-details component will get the city ID from the URL and a forecast from the data service upon request.\\n\\nFirst of all, change our **data types City and Forecast**:\\n\\n**city.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nexport interface City {\\n id: number;\\n name: string;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**forecast.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nexport interface Forecast {\\n cityId: number;\\n conditions: string;\\n wind: {\\n   speed: number;\\n   direction: string;\\n };\\n temperature: {\\n   day: {\\n     min: number;\\n     max: number;\\n   },\\n   night: {\\n     min: number;\\n     max: number;\\n   }\\n };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNext, we rewrite the mocks to match **the new data types:**\\n\\n**cities.mock.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\\n\\nexport const CITIES: Array<City> = [\\n {\\n   id: 0,\\n   name: 'New-York'\\n },\\n {\\n   id: 1,\\n   name: 'London'\\n },\\n {\\n   id: 2,\\n   name: 'Tokyo'\\n }\\n];\\n```\\n\\n**forecasts.mock.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Forecast } from '../core/interfaces/forecast';\\n\\nexport const FORECASTS: Array<Forecast> = [\\n   {\\n       cityId: 0,\\n       conditions: 'cloudy',\\n       wind: {\\n           speed: 6,\\n           direction: 'north-west'\\n       },\\n       temperature: {\\n           day: {\\n               min: 14,\\n               max: 18\\n           },\\n           night: {\\n               min: 5,\\n               max: 8\\n           }\\n       }\\n   },\\n   {\\n       cityId: 1,\\n       conditions: 'rain',\\n       wind: {\\n           speed: 3,\\n           direction: 'east'\\n       },\\n       temperature: {\\n           day: {\\n               min: 11,\\n               max: 14\\n           },\\n           night: {\\n               min: 3,\\n               max: 7\\n           }\\n       }\\n   },\\n   {\\n       cityId: 2,\\n       conditions: 'sunny',\\n       wind: {\\n           speed: 2,\\n           direction: 'south'\\n       },\\n       temperature: {\\n           day: {\\n               min: 22,\\n               max: 28\\n           },\\n           night: {\\n               min: 16,\\n               max: 19\\n           }\\n       }\\n   }\\n];\\n```\\n\\nSince the \\\"getCities\\\" method of the data service now returns a list of cities without weather forecasts, we add the method for obtaining the forecast for the city ID to it:\\n\\n**city.service.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\\n\\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\\nimport { Forecast } from '../interfaces/forecast';\\nimport { CITIES } from '../../mocks/cities.mock';\\nimport { FORECASTS } from '../../mocks/forecasts.mock';\\n\\n@Injectable({\\n providedIn: 'root'\\n})\\nexport class CityService {\\n\\n getCities(): Array<City> {\\n   return CITIES;\\n }\\n\\n getForecast(cityId: number): Forecast {\\n   return FORECASTS.find(forecast => forecast.cityId === cityId);\\n }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Getting the parameters from routing\\n![getting-the-parameters-from-routing](/blog/content/images/2018/10/getting-the-parameters.png)\\n\\nThe essence of the method is that we are looking for an element in the \\\"FORECASTS\\\" array whose \\\"cityId\\\" field matches the city ID passed to the method as a parameter.\\n\\nSo, reorganize the weather-details component to get the forecast with the ID parameter from the router.\\n\\n**weather-details.component.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';\\n\\nimport { Forecast } from '../../core/interfaces/forecast';\\nimport { CityService } from '../../core/services/city.service';\\n\\n@Component({\\n selector: 'app-weather-details',\\n templateUrl: './weather-details.component.html',\\n styleUrls: ['./weather-details.component.scss']\\n})\\nexport class WeatherDetailsComponent implements OnInit {\\n\\n forecast: Forecast;\\n\\n constructor(\\n   private route: ActivatedRoute,\\n   private cityService: CityService\\n ) { }\\n\\nngOnInit() {\\n this.route.params.subscribe(params => this.initializeForecast(+params.id));\\n}\\n\\ninitializeForecast(id: number) {\\n this.forecast = this.cityService.getForecast(id);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere we import the **ActivatedRoute** and implement it into the component using the dependency injection mechanism discussed in the previous article. Now with the help of the \\\"route\\\" variable, we can get the object with the variables that were passed by routing. \\n\\nTo do this, we use the object \\\"params\\\" which has the **type \\\"Behavior Subject\\\".** This is one of the observable data types provided by the RxJs library. Working with the methods of this library cannot be considered within one article, so we will limit it to using it only to receive the parameters from the routing. \\n\\nAs you can see from the code, to get the city ID from the routing we **used the \\\"subscribe\\\" method**, which allows us to subscribe to the data change in the observed source, and in case of such a change, to call the callback function with the routing parameter passed as argument. In our case, as a function, we call **the \\\"initializeForecast\\\" method** and pass the received ID to it. Knowing the city's ID, we can use the **\\\"getForecast\\\" method** of the city.service to get the object with the weather forecast. \\n\\nThe best way to do it is when the component is initialized, in the **ngOnInit method.** Since in the specification of the \\\"getForecast\\\" method we specified the type of the received parameter as \\\"number\\\", when the initializeForecast method is called, we convert the ID received from the routing from a string to a number. As a result, in the **variable \\\"forecast\\\"** we will get the object of the **type \\\"Forecast\\\"** for the selected city.\\n\\nThe next task to perform will be the modification of the weather component in order to change the route by clicking on a certain city. To do this, first of all, we modify the weather component class, since at the moment most of the functions implemented in it are no longer required.\\n\\n**weather.component.ts**\\n``` javascript\\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\\n\\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\\n\\n@Component({\\n selector: 'app-weather',\\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\\n})\\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\\n\\n cities: Array<City> = [];\\n\\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { }\\n\\n ngOnInit() {\\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities();\\n }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe removed the method of processing the click on the city name and now here it is implemented only obtaining a list of all cities in the initialization phase of the component. \\n\\nThe **weather component template** was also changed:\\n\\n**weather.component.html**\\n``` javascript\\n<div class=\\\"page\\\">\\n <div class=\\\"page-header\\\">Weather Forecast</div>\\n <div class=\\\"page-body\\\">\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__sidebar\\\">\\n     <ul class=\\\"cities-list\\\">\\n       <li class=\\\"cities-list__item\\\" *ngFor=\\\"let city of cities\\\">\\n           <a [routerLink]=\\\"['details', city.id]\\\">{{ city.name }}</a>\\n       </li>\\n     </ul>\\n   </div>\\n   <div class=\\\"page-body__details\\\">\\n     <router-outlet></router-outlet>\\n   </div>\\n </div>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nLet's briefly describe what we did. \\n**Firstly,** we converted the city name in the list into a link. \\n**Secondly,** instead of using the \\\"href\\\" attribute, we applied the \\\"routerLink\\\" directive to it, which is responsible for switching to routes and passing parameters with their help. \\n\\nIn our case, since we have determined that the \\\"details\\\" route assumes the transfer of the parameter (id), we will give an array of two elements: a string with the name of the route and a parameter (the ID of the selected city).\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also, read our article about Part 1 for this Guide: [Creating Basic Angular Application in 10 minutes - Part 1](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/creating-basic-angular-application-in-10-minutes-part-1/)</b>\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nAs a result, when you click on one of the cities, you will go to the route \\\"details\\\" with the city ID as the parameter. When moving to a route, you can see the rendering of the weather-details component template after the router-outlet of the weather component template.\\n\\nDuring the initialization phase of the weather-details component, we subscribe to the parameters that are passing using router. As soon as the change parameter event occurs (formally - moving to the router with any parameter), a query is made to the data service to receive the object with the weather forecast. When such an object is obtained, it is assigned to the component variable \\\"forecast\\\" from which it is already directly displayed in the template.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>In the previous article, we created a simple Angular application to display the weather forecast. We created two components - the weather component and the weather-details component. We received weather data from the mock file and provided it through the service to the weather component, and further into the weather-details component of each city. Then, by clicking on one of the cities we displayed corresponding weather-details component.</p>\n<p>Finally, our application looked like this:<br>\n<img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed1.png\" alt=\"final-look-of-our-angular-app\"></p>\n<p>It can be assumed that we are not satisfied with this application template. Now we want to have the list of cities and weather forecast inside different blocks of the page. Let's go further: suppose that our application will continue to evolve, and other functions will appear beside the weather forecast - for example, displaying of news, exchanging rates, etc. The most intuitive interface, in this case, will be a classic layout with a sidebar containing links on the left side and the main content on the right side. The sidebar will always be present on the screen and only the part with the main content will change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addingroutingtotheapplication\">Adding routing to the application</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/adding-routing.png\" alt=\"adding-routing-to-the-application\"></p>\n<p>So we have got close to the use of routing in Angular. And the layout described above in single-page applications is realized with its help.</p>\n<p>First, let's imagine the <strong>new structure</strong> of our application:<br>\n<img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed2-1.png\" alt=\"new-structure-of-our-application\"></p>\n<p>We have modify the layout of the weather component and remove template binding to the weather-details component. Instead, we will create a routing node using Angular features.</p>\n<p><strong>weather.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">...\n   &lt;div class=&quot;page-body__details&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;!--Router will be here soon--&gt;\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, let's start reorganizing our application using Angular routing. The best practice is to create separate modules for routing functionality.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do in the root component template is to specify the location where the corresponding components will be rendered when navigating to the particular route.</p>\n<p>Angular provides a special tag to do this - <strong><code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;</code></strong>. In our case, the root component template will look like this:</p>\n<p><strong>app.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The best practice is to create separate modules for routing functionality. Therefore, we will create a root routing module - <strong>an app-routing.module.</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: 'weather', loadChildren: './weather/weather.module#WeatherModule' },\n { path: '', redirectTo: 'weather', pathMatch: 'full' }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes) ],\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\n})\nexport class AppRoutingModule { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we defined the constant appRoutes, which is an array of routes that describes the routing scheme relative to the application root. Namely, we will have one &quot;weather&quot; route, according to which the weather component will be rendered in place of the router-outlet component. We also determined that when you go to an empty route, you will be redirected to the &quot;weather&quot; route.</p>\n<p><em>Note: here we use the feature of Angular routing - lazy-loading modules. This technology allows the builder (Webpack, etc.) to allocate lazy loadable modules with separate files, which are downloaded by the browser only in case of switching over the corresponding routing.</em></p>\n<p>Next, we import the Router Module and configure it, passing our array with routes to its <strong>&quot;forRoot&quot; method</strong>. Finally, we export the configured <strong>Router Module</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now modify the root module of the application:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [ AppComponent ],\n imports: [\n   BrowserModule,\n   AppRoutingModule\n ],\n providers: [],\n bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we no longer import and declare the weather and weather-details components in the app module. Instead, we import <strong>app-routing module.</strong> It should be mentioned that the weather and weather-details components will be declared in their own modules, that we will create later.<br>\n<em>Note: do not forget to delete weather and weather-details components declaration in app module.</em></p>\n<p>The mechanism of lazy loading modules by its definition involves loading the module, which declares the corresponding component. In addition, if a module is a routing node, it must have its own routing module.<br>\nNext, we will <strong>create weather and weather-routing modules</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>weather-routing.module.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather.component';\n\nconst weatherRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: '', component: WeatherComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n imports: [ RouterModule.forChild(weatherRoutes) ],\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\n})\nexport class WeatherRoutingModule { }\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>weather.module.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\n\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather.component';\nimport { WeatherRoutingModule } from './weather-routing.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [ WeatherComponent ],\n imports: [\n   CommonModule,\n   WeatherRoutingModule\n ]\n})\nexport class WeatherModule { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the same way, as we did earlier, we create a routing configuration for the weather node and store it in the <strong>weatherRoutes array</strong>. We import the <strong>Router Module</strong> again and configure it, but using <strong>&quot;forChild&quot; method</strong>, since our node is not the root.</p>\n<p>Weather module was indicated as a lazy-loadable module above. So it is loaded when the user is going to the “weather” route. Here we declared the weather component, imported the routing module and the common module necessary for using a number of Angular common directives (such as ngIf, ngFor, ngClass, etc.) in the component template.</p>\n<p>If everything was done correctly, after compilation, we will not see any changes in the appearance of our application, as in fact we just changed its architecture.</p>\n<p>It would be logical to assume that when clicking on one of the cities we should go to the <strong>&quot;weather/detail/&lt;city_id&gt;&quot;</strong> route and display the weather forecast for the selected city with the weather-details component on the right side of our application.<br>\nSo, let's add the router-outlet to the place where the forecast will be rendered.</p>\n<p><strong>weather.component.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">...\n&lt;div class=&quot;page-body__details&quot;&gt;\n &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, <strong>create a module for the weather-details component</strong>, as well as the routing module for it.</p>\n<p><strong>weather-details-routing.module.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nimport { WeatherDetailsComponent } from './weather-details.component';\n\nconst weatherDetailsRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: '', component: WeatherDetailsComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n imports: [ RouterModule.forChild(weatherDetailsRoutes) ],\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\n})\nexport class WeatherDetailsRoutingModule { }\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>weather-details.module.ts</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\n\nimport { WeatherDetailsComponent } from './weather-details.component';\nimport { WeatherDetailsRoutingModule } from './weather-details-routing.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [ WeatherDetailsComponent ],\n imports: [\n   CommonModule,\n   WeatherDetailsRoutingModule\n ]\n})\nexport class WeatherDetailsModule { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, with the weather component, we prepared the <strong>weather-details component</strong> for inclusion in our routing system, as a lazily-loaded module. Earlier we dealt with the child components, and now we will analyze the notion of child routes. Since the weather-details component remains in the application hierarchy as a child relative to the weather component, we will represent the route for it as a child to the &quot;weather&quot; route.<br>\nTo do this, we change the configuration of the weather component routing.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const weatherRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: '',\n   component: WeatherComponent,\n   children: [\n     { path: 'details/:id', loadChildren: './weather-details/weather-details.module#WeatherDetailsModule' }\n   ]\n }\n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we added a child route to the already existing &quot;weather&quot; route. Also, in the configuration of the routing, we indicated the mandatory parameter of the city ID.<br>\nAs a result, for the output of the forecast, we need to go to the URL like <strong>&quot;weather/details/2&quot;.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"changingdatatypesandtheservicetoworkwiththem\">Changing data types and the service to work with them</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/10/changing-data-types.png\" alt=\"changing-data-types-and-the-service-to-work-with-them\"></p>\n<p>Go to the <strong>weather-details component.</strong> At the moment, it involves retrieving from the parent component an object with a weather forecast to display it.

We created two components - the weather component and the\nweather-details component. We received weather data from the mock file and\nprovided it through the service to the weather component, and further into the\nweather-details component of each city. Then, by clicking on one of the cities\nwe displayed corresponding weather-details component.\n\nFinally, our application looked like this:\n\n\nIt can be assumed that we are not satisfied with this application template. Now\nwe want to have the list of cities and weather forecast inside different blocks\nof the page. Let's go further: suppose that our application will continue to\nevolve, and other functions will appear beside the weather forecast - for\nexample, displaying of news, exchanging rates, etc. The most intuitive\ninterface, in this case, will be a classic layout with a sidebar containing\nlinks on the left side and the main content on the right side. The sidebar will\nalways be present on the screen and only the part with the main content will\nchange.\n\nAdding routing to the application\n\n\nSo we have got close to the use of routing in Angular. And the layout described\nabove in single-page applications is realized with its help.\n\nFirst, let's imagine the new structure  of our application:\n\n\nWe have modify the layout of the weather component and remove template binding\nto the weather-details component. Instead, we will create a routing node using\nAngular features.\n\nweather.component.html\n\n...\n   <div class=\"page-body__details\">\n     <!--Router will be here soon-->\n   </div>\n...\n\n\nSo, let's start reorganizing our application using Angular routing. The best\npractice is to create separate modules for routing functionality.\n\nThe first thing to do in the root component template is to specify the location\nwhere the corresponding components will be rendered when navigating to the\nparticular route.\n\nAngular provides a special tag to do this - <router-outlet>. In our case, the\nroot component template will look like this:\n\napp.component.html\n\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n\n\nThe best practice is to create separate modules for routing functionality.\nTherefore, we will create a root routing module - an app-routing.module.\n\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nconst appRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: 'weather', loadChildren: './weather/weather.module#WeatherModule' },\n { path: '', redirectTo: 'weather', pathMatch: 'full' }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes) ],\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\n})\nexport class AppRoutingModule { }\n\n\nHere we defined the constant appRoutes, which is an array of routes that\ndescribes the routing scheme relative to the application root. Namely, we will\nhave one \"weather\" route, according to which the weather component will be\nrendered in place of the router-outlet component. We also determined that when\nyou go to an empty route, you will be redirected to the \"weather\" route.\n\nNote: here we use the feature of Angular routing - lazy-loading modules. This\ntechnology allows the builder (Webpack, etc.) to allocate lazy loadable modules\nwith separate files, which are downloaded by the browser only in case of\nswitching over the corresponding routing.\n\nNext, we import the Router Module and configure it, passing our array with\nroutes to its \"forRoot\" method. Finally, we export the configured Router Module.\n\nNow modify the root module of the application:\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [ AppComponent ],\n imports: [\n   BrowserModule,\n   AppRoutingModule\n ],\n providers: [],\n bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\n\n\nAs you can see, we no longer import and declare the weather and weather-details\ncomponents in the app module. Instead, we import app-routing module.  It should\nbe mentioned that the weather and weather-details components will be declared in\ntheir own modules, that we will create later.\nNote: do not forget to delete weather and weather-details components declaration\nin app module.\n\nThe mechanism of lazy loading modules by its definition involves loading the\nmodule, which declares the corresponding component. In addition, if a module is\na routing node, it must have its own routing module.\nNext, we will create weather and weather-routing modules:\n\nweather-routing.module.ts\n\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather.component';\n\nconst weatherRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: '', component: WeatherComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n imports: [ RouterModule.forChild(weatherRoutes) ],\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\n})\nexport class WeatherRoutingModule { }\n\n\nweather.module.ts\n\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\n\nimport { WeatherComponent } from './weather.component';\nimport { WeatherRoutingModule } from './weather-routing.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [ WeatherComponent ],\n imports: [\n   CommonModule,\n   WeatherRoutingModule\n ]\n})\nexport class WeatherModule { }\n\n\nIn the same way, as we did earlier, we create a routing configuration for the\nweather node and store it in the weatherRoutes array. We import the Router\nModule  again and configure it, but using \"forChild\" method, since our node is\nnot the root.\n\nWeather module was indicated as a lazy-loadable module above. So it is loaded\nwhen the user is going to the “weather” route. Here we declared the weather\ncomponent, imported the routing module and the common module necessary for using\na number of Angular common directives (such as ngIf, ngFor, ngClass, etc.) in\nthe component template.\n\nIf everything was done correctly, after compilation, we will not see any changes\nin the appearance of our application, as in fact we just changed its\narchitecture.\n\nIt would be logical to assume that when clicking on one of the cities we should\ngo to the \"weather/detail/<city_id>\"  route and display the weather forecast for\nthe selected city with the weather-details component on the right side of our\napplication.\nSo, let's add the router-outlet to the place where the forecast will be\nrendered.\n\nweather.component.html\n\n...\n<div class=\"page-body__details\">\n <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n</div>\n...\n\n\nNext, create a module for the weather-details component, as well as the routing\nmodule for it.\n\nweather-details-routing.module.ts\n\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';\n\nimport { WeatherDetailsComponent } from './weather-details.component';\n\nconst weatherDetailsRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: '', component: WeatherDetailsComponent }\n];\n\n@NgModule({\n imports: [ RouterModule.forChild(weatherDetailsRoutes) ],\n exports: [ RouterModule ]\n})\nexport class WeatherDetailsRoutingModule { }\n\n\nweather-details.module.ts\n\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\n\nimport { WeatherDetailsComponent } from './weather-details.component';\nimport { WeatherDetailsRoutingModule } from './weather-details-routing.module';\n\n@NgModule({\n declarations: [ WeatherDetailsComponent ],\n imports: [\n   CommonModule,\n   WeatherDetailsRoutingModule\n ]\n})\nexport class WeatherDetailsModule { }\n\n\nSimilarly, with the weather component, we prepared the weather-details component \n for inclusion in our routing system, as a lazily-loaded module. Earlier we\ndealt with the child components, and now we will analyze the notion of child\nroutes. Since the weather-details component remains in the application hierarchy\nas a child relative to the weather component, we will represent the route for it\nas a child to the \"weather\" route.\nTo do this, we change the configuration of the weather component routing.\n\nconst weatherRoutes: Routes = [\n { path: '',\n   component: WeatherComponent,\n   children: [\n     { path: 'details/:id', loadChildren: './weather-details/weather-details.module#WeatherDetailsModule' }\n   ]\n }\n];\n\n\nAs you can see, we added a child route to the already existing \"weather\" route.\nAlso, in the configuration of the routing, we indicated the mandatory parameter\nof the city ID.\nAs a result, for the output of the forecast, we need to go to the URL like \n\"weather/details/2\".\n\nChanging data types and the service to work with them\n\n\nGo to the weather-details component.  At the moment, it involves retrieving from\nthe parent component an object with a weather forecast to display it. Now we\nwill go the other way: the weather-details component will get the city ID from\nthe URL and a forecast from the data service upon request.\n\nFirst of all, change our data types City and Forecast:\n\ncity.ts\n\nexport interface City {\n id: number;\n name: string;\n}\n\n\nforecast.ts\n\nexport interface Forecast {\n cityId: number;\n conditions: string;\n wind: {\n   speed: number;\n   direction: string;\n };\n temperature: {\n   day: {\n     min: number;\n     max: number;\n   },\n   night: {\n     min: number;\n     max: number;\n   }\n };\n}\n\n\nNext, we rewrite the mocks to match the new data types:\n\ncities.mock.ts\n\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\n\nexport const CITIES: Array<City> = [\n {\n   id: 0,\n   name: 'New-York'\n },\n {\n   id: 1,\n   name: 'London'\n },\n {\n   id: 2,\n   name: 'Tokyo'\n }\n];\n\n\nforecasts.mock.ts\n\nimport { Forecast } from '../core/interfaces/forecast';\n\nexport const FORECASTS: Array<Forecast> = [\n   {\n       cityId: 0,\n       conditions: 'cloudy',\n       wind: {\n           speed: 6,\n           direction: 'north-west'\n       },\n       temperature: {\n           day: {\n               min: 14,\n               max: 18\n           },\n           night: {\n               min: 5,\n               max: 8\n           }\n       }\n   },\n   {\n       cityId: 1,\n       conditions: 'rain',\n       wind: {\n           speed: 3,\n           direction: 'east'\n       },\n       temperature: {\n           day: {\n               min: 11,\n               max: 14\n           },\n           night: {\n               min: 3,\n               max: 7\n           }\n       }\n   },\n   {\n       cityId: 2,\n       conditions: 'sunny',\n       wind: {\n           speed: 2,\n           direction: 'south'\n       },\n       temperature: {\n           day: {\n               min: 22,\n               max: 28\n           },\n           night: {\n               min: 16,\n               max: 19\n           }\n       }\n   }\n];\n\n\nSince the \"getCities\" method of the data service now returns a list of cities\nwithout weather forecasts, we add the method for obtaining the forecast for the\ncity ID to it:\n\ncity.service.ts\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { City } from '../interfaces/city';\nimport { Forecast } from '../interfaces/forecast';\nimport { CITIES } from '../../mocks/cities.mock';\nimport { FORECASTS } from '../../mocks/forecasts.mock';\n\n@Injectable({\n providedIn: 'root'\n})\nexport class CityService {\n\n getCities(): Array<City> {\n   return CITIES;\n }\n\n getForecast(cityId: number): Forecast {\n   return FORECASTS.find(forecast => forecast.cityId === cityId);\n }\n\n}\n\n\nGetting the parameters from routing\n\n\nThe essence of the method is that we are looking for an element in the\n\"FORECASTS\" array whose \"cityId\" field matches the city ID passed to the method\nas a parameter.\n\nSo, reorganize the weather-details component to get the forecast with the ID\nparameter from the router.\n\nweather-details.component.ts\n\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';\n\nimport { Forecast } from '../../core/interfaces/forecast';\nimport { CityService } from '../../core/services/city.service';\n\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather-details',\n templateUrl: './weather-details.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather-details.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WeatherDetailsComponent implements OnInit {\n\n forecast: Forecast;\n\n constructor(\n   private route: ActivatedRoute,\n   private cityService: CityService\n ) { }\n\nngOnInit() {\n this.route.params.subscribe(params => this.initializeForecast(+params.id));\n}\n\ninitializeForecast(id: number) {\n this.forecast = this.cityService.getForecast(id);\n}\n\n\nHere we import the ActivatedRoute  and implement it into the component using the\ndependency injection mechanism discussed in the previous article. Now with the\nhelp of the \"route\" variable, we can get the object with the variables that were\npassed by routing.\n\nTo do this, we use the object \"params\" which has the type \"Behavior Subject\". \nThis is one of the observable data types provided by the RxJs library. Working\nwith the methods of this library cannot be considered within one article, so we\nwill limit it to using it only to receive the parameters from the routing.\n\nAs you can see from the code, to get the city ID from the routing we used the\n\"subscribe\" method, which allows us to subscribe to the data change in the\nobserved source, and in case of such a change, to call the callback function\nwith the routing parameter passed as argument. In our case, as a function, we\ncall the \"initializeForecast\" method  and pass the received ID to it. Knowing\nthe city's ID, we can use the \"getForecast\" method  of the city.service to get\nthe object with the weather forecast.\n\nThe best way to do it is when the component is initialized, in the ngOnInit\nmethod.  Since in the specification of the \"getForecast\" method we specified the\ntype of the received parameter as \"number\", when the initializeForecast method\nis called, we convert the ID received from the routing from a string to a\nnumber. As a result, in the variable \"forecast\"  we will get the object of the \ntype \"Forecast\"  for the selected city.\n\nThe next task to perform will be the modification of the weather component in\norder to change the route by clicking on a certain city. To do this, first of\nall, we modify the weather component class, since at the moment most of the\nfunctions implemented in it are no longer required.\n\nweather.component.ts\n\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { City } from '../core/interfaces/city';\nimport { CityService } from '../core/services/city.service';\n\n@Component({\n selector: 'app-weather',\n templateUrl: './weather.component.html',\n styleUrls: ['./weather.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WeatherComponent implements OnInit {\n\n cities: Array<City> = [];\n\n constructor(private cityService: CityService) { }\n\n ngOnInit() {\n   this.cities = this.cityService.getCities();\n }\n\n}\n\n\nWe removed the method of processing the click on the city name and now here it\nis implemented only obtaining a list of all cities in the initialization phase\nof the component.\n\nThe weather component template  was also changed:\n\nweather.component.html\n\n<div class=\"page\">\n <div class=\"page-header\">Weather Forecast</div>\n <div class=\"page-body\">\n   <div class=\"page-body__sidebar\">\n     <ul class=\"cities-list\">\n       <li class=\"cities-list__item\" *ngFor=\"let city of cities\">\n           <a [routerLink]=\"['details', city.id]\">{{ city.name }}</a>\n       </li>\n     </ul>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"page-body__details\">\n     <router-outlet></router-outlet>\n   </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\nLet's briefly describe what we did.\nFirstly,  we converted the city name in the list into a link.\nSecondly,  instead of using the \"href\" attribute, we applied the \"routerLink\"\ndirective to it, which is responsible for switching to routes and passing\nparameters with their help.\n\nIn our case, since we have determined that the \"details\" route assumes the\ntransfer of the parameter (id), we will give an array of two elements: a string\nwith the name of the route and a parameter (the ID of the selected city).\n\nAlso, read our article about Part 1 for this Guide: Creating Basic Angular\nApplication in 10 minutes - Part 1\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/creating-basic-angular-application-in-10-minutes-part-1/]\n\nConclusions\nAs a result, when you click on one of the cities, you will go to the route\n\"details\" with the city ID as the parameter. When moving to a route, you can see\nthe rendering of the weather-details component template after the router-outlet\nof the weather component template.\n\nDuring the initialization phase of the weather-details component, we subscribe\nto the parameters that are passing using router.

The marketplace provides many sellers and many buyers in contrast to online shops where only one seller is present. \\nAnother important point that you should know that there exists a vertical and horizontal model of doing business. Vertical businesses sell goods of only one industry segment and horizontal model offers goods/ services from various spheres.\\n\\nIn this article 3 types of marketplaces will be considered: B2B, B2C, and C2C. Of course, there are much more types such as mCommerce and eCommerce marketplaces, auction platforms, crowdfunding, but this article will focus on B2B, B2C, and C2C marketplaces.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Top 10 online marketplaces according to the selling rates in current year](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/top-10-online-marketplaces-that-sell/)</b>\\n\\nSo, let’s consider the first marketplace type.\\n\\n## С2С (customer-to-customer) marketplaces\\n![c2c-marketplace](/blog/content/images/2018/10/c2c-2.png)\\n\\nIt means that all participants are equal. Sometimes this type is called P2P meaning the interaction between users: peer-to-peer, people-to-people, person-to-person.\\nPeople, coming to the platform aren’t business owners. They want to sell or to get something and arrange for it on favourable terms. The marketplace helps them to save money. The users unite different communities. They switch roles: today they buy and tomorrow they will sell.\\n\\nConcerning money saving: The good example is a ridesharing marketplace BlaBlaCar.\\nIt helps the drivers to find passengers and vice versa. The drivers have got a free place in their car and the passengers don’t spend much money. The websites tell about the saving possibility in the front page.\\nIt’s called sharing economy when the cost is shared among all participants. The similar search Lyft promises to help save up to 60% of the travel cost.\\n \\nDespite the money economy, the participants get other important benefits / new acquaintances, an interesting ride, mobility (they can discuss time, route and stops with the driver).\\n\\nNot only money saving can be the main reason for users. For example, Couchsurfing is a service for travellers, the registered users can live in each city of the world for free - the bed and hot meal are offered by the host. But despite money saving this service is interesting for other reasons. Travellers have the possibility to contact the locals, to see how they live and to share travel experience. That’s why the front page of Couchsurfing doesn’t mention money saving, it remembers another attraction: stay with locals and meet travelers.\\n\\nAll C2C marketplaces build communities of interest. These are traveling for Couchsurfing, hand-made things for Etsy or pets for DogVacay. The users come to the platform because it fits their interests, and start using the service.\\n\\nIn the C2C model all users are equal and one can both offer and get service. So participants can switch roles. For example, SkillShare offers learning online after choosing the needed topic. If you have good skills in some sphere, make a video on the website about your skills and find pupils. So users can both learn and teach. \\nPreply - the marketplace for tutor search has got a similar approach. The service helps to learn languages in skype or to teach your native language.\\nWhat is the conclusion about C2C marketplaces? The clear division of roles isn’t present here, the interests of users are similar and the conditions are profitable for both participants.\\n\\n## B2B (business-to-business) marketplaces\\n![b2b-marketplace](/blog/content/images/2018/10/b2b.png)\\n\\nBusiness-to-business means that one business sells something to another business on favourable terms. For example, many marketplaces from China work like that: the business owner from the other country orders wholesale supplying from the Chinese business owner.\\n\\nThe marketplace can work as B2C but create a separate offer for businesses.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Building your marketplace app. Your step-by-step guide](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-create-an-online-marketplace-app/)</b>\\n\\nLet’s remember about the marketplace used by almost every traveler: Booking.com. It is a B2C marketplace. It helps to book hotels and apartments all around the world. But its subproject Booking belongs to the B2B marketplace and is intended for tour operators, travel agents, and carriers. All its users are small and large businesses.\\nOne side is represented by hotel owners and the other side  - by tour operators which want to save money at booking and to get volume discounts. \\nAnother good example is Alibaba marketplace, which allows the business owners to order wholesale supplying.

To become competitive you should pay attention to the product definition. The customers have to find your app quickly and it has to have the right name and to look interesting enough to be downloaded.\\n \\n**The name** should have keywords, and you can write up to 25 characters in the name of the app. When people search they have a possibility to see exactly them.\\n \\n**Description:** It shouldn’t exceed 225 characters. Use keywords here (but don’t overdo it!). Remember to tell the users clearly how the app will help them. Describe in details, over which main characteristics and functions the app possesses but there is no need to mention technical details.\\n\\nIf your app has already existed for some time and you’re updating it, mention the new features, special achievements or bug-fixing.\\n\\nThe look of screenshots provides additional information about your app.\\n\\nLet’s consider the name and the description more precisely.\\n\\n## What options must have the app name\\n![app-name](/blog/content/images/2018/10/app-name.png)\\n\\nSometimes when you flip through new apps and read their names you don’t understand what they are for. So there appears no interest to download one of them. The first conclusion is: don’t invent an incomprehensible name. \\nIt would be better to name the app after its goal. \\n \\nBoth Apple Store and Google shorten the app names and both of them change these options often:\\n* Google Play: 28-30 symbols;\\n* iOS App Store: recommends up to 23 characters but allows to 255.\\n\\nThere are many competitors in the market so create the name which is easy to remember and stands out among many similar apps.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Top 9 steps for the application development](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/)</b>\\n\\n## What should be the app description\\n![app-description](/blog/content/images/2018/10/description.png)\\nIf you were a user, what would be interesting for you to find? \\nHow long would you be looking at the separate app in the store? \\nWhat would your eye capture at once?\\n\\n* **You shouldn’t use more than 255 characters.** This text appears if the user taps on the button “more”. If this text doesn’t motivate users to read further, the whole job on the app creation was in vain.\\n\\n* **Mention the review and awards, if they are present.** If the review about the app was made by some journal, use it as an additional motivation for users.\\n    * Start with an attention-grabbing sentence and tell the users why your app is so cool. It should solve some problem, entertain a user or make his life more comfortable.\\n    * If there are no reviews from journals, include a review written by a regular user.\\n    \\n\\n* **The body text should consist of 2-3 paragraphs.** You don’t write an essay, so you should make simple unambiguous sentences provoking to do something (download and enjoy reading; forget spending too much money for …, etc.)\\n    * Firstly you should write the most interesting and fascinating things about your app, and the details follow. Remember, that people can flip through new apps standing in the queue, sitting in the car, so they don’t have much time for reading long sentences.\\n    * Don’t write the same sentence for many times, because it’ll bother users.\\n\\n* **Features.**\\n    * The descriptions have to be short;\\n    * Write the most important ones in the upper lines and in the line at the end. Usually, people don’t read much in the centre of the text, they read upper and lower lines but overlook the centre. \\n    * Of course, there are many apps with so many functions, but please don’t waste users’ time to count all of them. Write down only those differing your app from similar apps. There must be one killer feature: your competitive advantage or positioning of your app on the market. Mention also the core functions: in what way is your app different from the others?\\n    * If the app offers hotel booking, inform the users about it in the first lines of your Android or IOS app description and take care that people understand the main app goal from the app name. Focus on the specific features and mention what problems are solved for the user.\\n    * If your app saves money in some way, write about it.\\n    * If there is a premium content, let the users find out about it after downloading the app.\\n\\n* **Mention “What’s new?”**\\n\\nTell about the changes, updates, and bug-fixing at the end of the app.\\n\\n## Screenshots and their description\\n\\nSometimes people creating screenshots try to show everything that the app can do. But remember the main goal: After looking through screenshots the user has to want to download the app. That’s why the clearest, the most interesting and informative screenshots have to be chosen. You may choose up to 5 screenshots. The first screenshot has to tell about the core feature. Other screenshots have to show the workflow. But the process in the screenshots isn’t clear at first sight, make textual descriptions. \\n\\n**These descriptions have to:**\\n1. Be short and clear. The users won’t read 5 lines of the text. \\n1. Mention the most important features of the app.\\n1. Provide readable characters’ size. \\n1. The background and the text should contrast, not merge.\\n\\nThere are some successful apps and their correct moves concerning name and description. \\nLet’s take a look over app description examples of **Blablacar** and **Skyscanner**.\\n![blablacar](/blog/content/images/2018/10/blablacar.png)\\n\\n<table dir=\\\"ltr\\\" border=\\\"1\\\" cellspacing=\\\"0\\\" cellpadding=\\\"0\\\"><colgroup><col width=\\\"113\\\" /><col width=\\\"781\\\" /><col width=\\\"1003\\\" /></colgroup>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\" data-sheets-value=\\\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Option&quot;}\\\"><strong>Option</strong></td>\\n<td style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\" data-sheets-value=\\\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;App name and the sentences from the description&quot;}\\\"><strong>App name and the sentences from the description</strong></td>\\n<td style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\" data-sheets-value=\\\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Pros of such a description&quot;}\\\"><strong>Pros of such a description</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\" data-sheets-value=\\\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;App name&quot;}\\\"><strong>App name</strong></td>\\n<td style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\" data-sheets-value=\\\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Blablacar&quot;}\\\"><strong>Blablacar</strong></td>\\n<td style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\" data-sheets-value=\\\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Looking at this name the user associates it with chatting and with cars or driving.

For your app to provoke\ninterest of many users, create a name associated with the main function of the\napp. Invent such a description which describes the killer feature and core\nfeatures in clear and simple words.\nScreenshots have to serve the main goal and give the impression that this app is\nreally interesting, simple and useful. Sometimes you need to make textual\ndescriptions.\nAll the descriptions have to be short! No ambiguous phrases, no jargon, and no\ncliche. The background and the text of screenshots should contrast, not merge.\nLook at the very successful applications in the Google and Apple Store and think\nwhy they achieved their success. You may take some ideas from them but don’t\noverdo it! If you are ready to get your app created, you are welcome to the \nskilled developers’ world [https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts].","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/10/preview-6.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Tips on How to Write a Successful App Name and Description That Sells in 2018","meta_description":"The description of the app has to be clear, fascinating and provoking interest.

In fact, **PWA** is a website that meets the following requirements:\\n1. **Reliability** - instant download and correct operation even in case of unstable network access;\\n1. **High performance** - immediate reaction to user actions, the use of various animation effects;\\n1. **User-friendly** - work in full-screen mode on any type of device with any screen size.\\n\\nIn other words, a **modern SPA** should implement the following functional:\\n1. *Contain a web manifest;*\\n1. *Have a service-worker* for caching application resources;\\n1. *Use https protocol.*\\n\\nWeb manifest is a JSON file, which contains some of the information about the application - name, description, icons of various sizes, options of application displaying.

Setup of an Angular project\\n![setup-of-an-angular-project](/blog/content/images/2018/10/setup.png)\\n\\nThe Angular team, as always, didn’t stay away from world trends and developed a mechanism for adding PWA capabilities to the Angular application. Let's see how this works on a real example.\\n\\nTo begin with, you should install (if not already installed) the latest version of Angular CLI globally into the system.\\n\\n> **npm install -g @angular/cli**\\n\\nNext, use it to create a new application:\\n\\n> **ng new progressive-web-app**\\n\\nIt should be noted that the web manifest can be tested using the development server, and if you want to see the work of the service worker, it will require the creation and serving of a production build.

Testing for PWA features\\n\\nNow on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ we have running build of our project without PWA features. Google Chrome Dev Tools on the Audit tab provides the ability to verify the website's compliance with the PWA template.\\n\\n![google-chrome-dev-tools-on-the-audit-tab](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed-2.png)\\n\\nAfter completing the analysis, we will see results that will not please us too much. Among the main mentioned drawbacks there is a lack of a service-worker, a web manifest, the redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, etc.\\n\\n![The-entire-list-of-identified-problems](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed--1-.png)\\n\\nThe entire list of identified problems can be conditionally divided into two groups: Application and Server shortcomings. Problems related to server settings are not relevant to the Angular application and will not receive significant attention in this article.\\n\\n## 3. Converting the app into PWA\\n![converting-the-app-into-PWA](/blog/content/images/2018/10/converting.png)\\n\\nAs already mentioned earlier, the creators of Angular have taken care of ensuring that the SPA in their framework meets modern requirements. To do this, it is enough to execute one Angular CLI command, which will convert our application into PWA.\\n\\n### 3.1 PWA package installation\\n\\n> **ng add @angular/pwa**\\n\\nBriefly about the made changes:\\n1. Dependencies @angular/service-worker and @angular/pwa were installed and saved in package.json.\\n1. ServiceWorkerModule was imported in AppModule.\\n1. File ngsw-config.json with service-worker configuration was created in the root directory of the project.\\n1. Set of icons was created in the assets’ directory.\\n1. manifest.json was created in the source directory, index.html and angular.json were updated with it.\\n1. section no-script was added to index.html.\\n\\n### 3.2 Service-worker configuration\\n\\nSo, let's start with the **service-worker.**\\n\\n``` javascript\\nServiceWorkerModule.register('/ngsw-worker.js', { \\n\\tenabled: environment.production \\n})\\n```\\n\\nWe imported the **ServiceWorkerModule** into the **AppModule** and registered the service-worker in the application for the production environment only. After that, the production assembly of our application will include a service worker. Here is its default configuration:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  \\\"index\\\": \\\"/index.html\\\",\\n  \\\"assetGroups\\\": [{\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"app\\\",\\n    \\\"installMode\\\": \\\"prefetch\\\",\\n    \\\"resources\\\": {\\n      \\\"files\\\": [\\n        \\\"/favicon.ico\\\",\\n        \\\"/index.html\\\",\\n        \\\"/*.css\\\",\\n        \\\"/*.js\\\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }, {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"assets\\\",\\n    \\\"installMode\\\": \\\"lazy\\\",\\n    \\\"updateMode\\\": \\\"prefetch\\\",\\n    \\\"resources\\\": {\\n      \\\"files\\\": [\\n        \\\"/assets/**\\\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*\\\"index\\\"* - path to the main index.html;\\n*\\\"assetGroups\\\"* - an array of groups of application resources with different caching options;\\n\\\"name\\\" - a name of the resources’ group;\\n*\\\"installMode\\\"* - string parameter, that determines the way in which the resources of the group will be initially cached:\\n*\\\"prefetch\\\"* means, that all application resources are cached regardless of the requests to load them;\\n*\\\"lazy\\\"* - caching only those resources, the request for which was sent to the server.\\n*\\\"updateMode\\\"* - determines the caching policy of resources that were previously cached, and at the given moment a new version was discovered. Like *\\\"installMode\\\"*, it can take the values of \\\"prefetch\\\" and \\\"lazy\\\";\\n*\\\"resources\\\"* - include paths to application resources to be cached. There are two types of resources paths:\\n*\\\"files\\\"* - paths to files in the project distribution directory;\\n*\\\"urls\\\"* - URLs or patterns of external resources requested by the application.\\n\\nAs you can see, the default settings of the **service-worker** assume immediate loading of the critical components of the application (index.html, all files of scripts, styles, and also the favicon). The lazy boot option is applied to all the contents of the assets’ directory since these resources are not so important for the application to work.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Optimization of the Angular 2+ app download speed](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-optimize-the-angular-app-download-speed/)</b>\\n\\n### 3.3 Web manifest configuration\\n\\nNext, let’s look at the web manifest.\\n\\nThe manifest file itself is in the source directory. During the project building, Webpack copies it to the distribution directory. The manifest is connected in the head of the document via a link.\\n\\n```javascript\\n<link rel=\\\"manifest\\\" href=\\\"manifest.json\\\">\\n```\\n\\nConsider the structure of the manifest generated with Angular CLI:\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"progressive-web-app\\\",\\n  \\\"short_name\\\": \\\"progressive-web-app\\\",\\n  \\\"theme_color\\\": \\\"#1976d2\\\",\\n  \\\"background_color\\\": \\\"#fafafa\\\",\\n  \\\"display\\\": \\\"standalone\\\",\\n  \\\"scope\\\": \\\"/\\\",\\n  \\\"start_url\\\": \\\"/\\\",\\n  \\\"icons\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"src\\\": \\\"assets/icons/icon-72x72.png\\\",\\n      \\\"sizes\\\": \\\"72x72\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"image/png\\\"\\n    },\\n    ...\\n    {\\n      \\\"src\\\": \\\"assets/icons/icon-512x512.png\\\",\\n      \\\"sizes\\\": \\\"512x512\\\",\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"image/png\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBriefly about the keys:\\n*\\\"name\\\"* - the name of the application that will be displayed below the icon;\\n*\\\"shortname\\\"* - will be used in cases where the place to display the full name is not enough;\\n*\\\"themecolor\\\"* - specifies meta attribute with name=\\\"theme-color\\\";\\n*\\\"backgroundcolor\\\"* - sets the color of the page before it boots;\\n*\\\"display\\\"* - is responsible for your site to be displayed (with address line or without it, etc.);\\n*\\\"starturl\\\"* - the URL that opens when you click the icon;\\n*\\\"icons\\\"* - set of icons of different sizes.\\n\\nTo check if the manifest is properly connected, you can also use **Chrome Dev Tools: Application tab -> Manifest.** If everything is done correctly, you will see something similar to the following picture, namely - the description of the site and a number of icons.\\n![Chrome-Dev-Tools-app-Manifest](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed2-2.png)\\n\\n## 4. PWA testing \\n\\nNow, after understanding the configuration of the **service-worker** and **web manifest**, it's time to check our application for compliance with the **PWA** again. The results will be much better than before.\\n![check-application-for-compliance-with-the-PWA](/blog/content/images/2018/10/unnamed3-1.png)\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nAs it was mentioned earlier, we don’t consider the server settings at the moment. And we have successfully eliminated all the shortcomings on the part of the application. In fact, all the work has been done by Angular CLI. In the case of a real project, we would only need to fill in the configuration files correctly and to replace the icons. Thus, we were convinced that the *transformation of the Angular application into PWA using the Angular CLI* proved to be extremely easy.\\n\\nThe code of the example considered in the article can be found in the GitHub repository.

In the framework of this\narticle, we will use the command line tool http-server (\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for serving production build.\n\nSo, create a production build of the project:\n\nng build --prod\n\nTo install http-server (if not already installed) globally run next command:\n\nnpm install -g http-server\n\nRun the server for our build without specifying any options:\n\nhttp-server ./dist/progressive-web-app\n\nAlso, read our article: Creating Basic Angular Application in 10 minutes - Part\n1\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/creating-basic-angular-application-in-10-minutes-part-1/]\n\n2. Testing for PWA features\nNow on http://127.0.0.1:8080/  we have running build of our project without PWA\nfeatures. Google Chrome Dev Tools on the Audit tab provides the ability to\nverify the website's compliance with the PWA template.\n\n\n\nAfter completing the analysis, we will see results that will not please us too\nmuch. Among the main mentioned drawbacks there is a lack of a service-worker, a\nweb manifest, the redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, etc.\n\n\n\nThe entire list of identified problems can be conditionally divided into two\ngroups: Application and Server shortcomings. Problems related to server settings\nare not relevant to the Angular application and will not receive significant\nattention in this article.\n\n3. Converting the app into PWA\n\n\nAs already mentioned earlier, the creators of Angular have taken care of\nensuring that the SPA in their framework meets modern requirements. To do this,\nit is enough to execute one Angular CLI command, which will convert our\napplication into PWA.\n\n3.1 PWA package installation\nng add @angular/pwa\n\nBriefly about the made changes:\n\n 1. Dependencies @angular/service-worker and @angular/pwa were installed and\n    saved in package.json.\n 2. ServiceWorkerModule was imported in AppModule.\n 3. File ngsw-config.json with service-worker configuration was created in the\n    root directory of the project.\n 4. Set of icons was created in the assets’ directory.\n 5. manifest.json was created in the source directory, index.html and\n    angular.json were updated with it.\n 6. section no-script was added to index.html.\n\n3.2 Service-worker configuration\nSo, let's start with the service-worker.\n\nServiceWorkerModule.register('/ngsw-worker.js', { \n\tenabled: environment.production \n})\n\n\nWe imported the ServiceWorkerModule  into the AppModule  and registered the\nservice-worker in the application for the production environment only. After\nthat, the production assembly of our application will include a service worker.\nHere is its default configuration:\n\n{\n  \"index\": \"/index.html\",\n  \"assetGroups\": [{\n    \"name\": \"app\",\n    \"installMode\": \"prefetch\",\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"files\": [\n        \"/favicon.ico\",\n        \"/index.html\",\n        \"/*.css\",\n        \"/*.js\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"assets\",\n    \"installMode\": \"lazy\",\n    \"updateMode\": \"prefetch\",\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"files\": [\n        \"/assets/**\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }]\n}\n\n\n\"index\"  - path to the main index.html;\n\"assetGroups\"  - an array of groups of application resources with different\ncaching options;\n\"name\" - a name of the resources’ group;\n\"installMode\"  - string parameter, that determines the way in which the\nresources of the group will be initially cached:\n\"prefetch\"  means, that all application resources are cached regardless of the\nrequests to load them;\n\"lazy\"  - caching only those resources, the request for which was sent to the\nserver.\n\"updateMode\"  - determines the caching policy of resources that were previously\ncached, and at the given moment a new version was discovered. Like \"installMode\"\n, it can take the values of \"prefetch\" and \"lazy\";\n\"resources\"  - include paths to application resources to be cached. There are\ntwo types of resources paths:\n\"files\"  - paths to files in the project distribution directory;\n\"urls\"  - URLs or patterns of external resources requested by the application.\n\nAs you can see, the default settings of the service-worker  assume immediate\nloading of the critical components of the application (index.html, all files of\nscripts, styles, and also the favicon). The lazy boot option is applied to all\nthe contents of the assets’ directory since these resources are not so important\nfor the application to work.\n\nAlso read our article: Optimization of the Angular 2+ app download speed\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-optimize-the-angular-app-download-speed/]\n\n3.3 Web manifest configuration\nNext, let’s look at the web manifest.\n\nThe manifest file itself is in the source directory. During the project\nbuilding, Webpack copies it to the distribution directory. The manifest is\nconnected in the head of the document via a link.\n\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"manifest.json\">\n\n\nConsider the structure of the manifest generated with Angular CLI:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"progressive-web-app\",\n  \"short_name\": \"progressive-web-app\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#1976d2\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#fafafa\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"scope\": \"/\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"assets/icons/icon-72x72.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"72x72\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n      \"src\": \"assets/icons/icon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nBriefly about the keys:\n\"name\"  - the name of the application that will be displayed below the icon;\n\"shortname\"  - will be used in cases where the place to display the full name is\nnot enough;\n\"themecolor\"  - specifies meta attribute with name=\"theme-color\";\n\"backgroundcolor\"  - sets the color of the page before it boots;\n\"display\"  - is responsible for your site to be displayed (with address line or\nwithout it, etc.);\n\"starturl\"  - the URL that opens when you click the icon;\n\"icons\"  - set of icons of different sizes.\n\nTo check if the manifest is properly connected, you can also use Chrome Dev\nTools: Application tab -> Manifest.  If everything is done correctly, you will\nsee something similar to the following picture, namely - the description of the\nsite and a number of icons.\n\n\n4. PWA testing\nNow, after understanding the configuration of the service-worker  and web\nmanifest, it's time to check our application for compliance with the PWA  again.\nThe results will be much better than before.\n\n\nConclusions\nAs it was mentioned earlier, we don’t consider the server settings at the\nmoment. And we have successfully eliminated all the shortcomings on the part of\nthe application. In fact, all the work has been done by Angular CLI. In the case\nof a real project, we would only need to fill in the configuration files\ncorrectly and to replace the icons. Thus, we were convinced that the \ntransformation of the Angular application into PWA using the Angular CLI  proved\nto be extremely easy.\n\nThe code of the example considered in the article can be found in the GitHub\nrepository.

Many of the features\nmentioned below are often used in the apps and with their help, the app becomes\nmore user-friendly.\n\n 1. Integration with social networks. It really saves time.

And of course, you should think of the monetization before you have begun building the app.\\n\\nFirst of all, you should know how to monetize mobile apps and decide which type you should use in your app.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Top recommendations of successful app name and description in 2018](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/top-recommendations-of-successful-app-name-and-description-in-2018/)</b>\\n\\n## Mobile app monetization strategies\\nThere are some types of monetization for mobile applications you need to know before developing an app. You should get acquainted with all of them and choose the proper ones for your app.\\n\\n### 1. In-app advertising\\nThere are many in-app advertising types and each of them should be considered more precisely. Here are the *main types of ads for mobile applications*:\\n* *Playable ads* are mini-games the users can play before they decide to install the full version. They provide users with enjoyable experience.\\n* *Rewarded video ads* - users get some coins, in-game currency or goods for watching this video.\\n* *Offerwall* looks like a mini-store and offers some in-game goods in exchange for completing a mini-game/installing an app or other. As usual, these tasks are user-initiated.\\n![offerwall](/blog/content/images/2018/11/offerwall.png)\\n* *Interstitial/full-screen ads* - appear when the user is switching between menus. They don’t annoy users because they appear at natural pause in the mobile app and offer clickable images or videos. \\n* *Video ads* (they are considered not as distracting and annoying as TV ads).\\n* *Notification ads* usually pop up in the status bar. You should know that these ads are sometimes annoying for users.\\n* *Banner ads* – they appear on the top or bottom of the screen. Be aware that they can sometimes irritate or distract users and it’s said that banner ads are dying out.\\n* *Native ads* are similar to banner ads but they blend with the natural mobile environment and the users can’t block them.\\n\\n### 2. Freemium\\n\\nThe users get basic functions free but they should pay for the whole functionality. The success of such apps depends on the number of users who are ready to pay. Be careful: if you give too much of basic functions, nobody will buy the whole functionality and if you give too little, the users refuse using the app because they are forced to pay at once.\\n\\n### 3. Subscriptions \\n\\nFirstly, the users can test drive the mobile app, read news, but they need to subscribe for some additional materials, reports etc. Usually, the free materials are restricted and the most interesting things e.g. articles you can only read after payment.\\nThe most well-known example is Medium, where you read some articles for free.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Top Tips for Improving Sales in your App](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/improving-sales-in-your-app/)</b>\\n\\n### 4. In-App Purchases (Physical or Virtual Goods)\\nSome goods (in-game currencies, new levels or others) are bought by the user, although the user can stay in the app without buying something.\\n![In-App-Purchases](/blog/content/images/2018/11/In-App-Purchases.png)\\n\\n### 5. Sponsorship\\nThe app itself is free but there are offers from the sponsor, e.g. there appears a video if the user comes to the next level, besides the app owner gets money for each offer.\\n\\nUsually the app owner and the sponsor have similar goals, for example, the app is a fitness app and the offers are sports clothes.\\n\\n### 6. Hybrid model. \\nWe named this model like that, meaning a model when several monetization ways are used in the mobile app.\\n\\nActually, many models can be blended in the same app. For example, in the same app you can make In-App Purchases (buying coins and other special in-game items which aren’t for free), additionally, there appear the interstitial ads and the app offers ads free option, where the user pays a fixed sum and isn’t shown ads anymore.\\n\\n## Mobile Monetization mistakes you need to avoid\\n![Mobile-Monetization-mistakes-you-need-to-avoid](/blog/content/images/2018/11/Mobile-Monetization-mistakes-you-need-to-avoid.png)\\n\\nPeople creating a mobile app sometimes make mistakes, especially if they are beginners. When you create an app and add advertisement, remember that it shouldn’t obscure the fun from the app itself. These ads shouldn’t be shown very often and be obtrusive.\\n\\nThere are some mistakes which should be avoided at the app creation. And of course, these mistakes prevent monetization, as well. As you know, forewarned is forearmed so let’s think of the most common mistakes.\\n\\n### 1. Creating monetization scheme at the very last stage of development\\n\\nMany people make such a mistake. But if you plan monetization at the development beginning then you can create a mobile app according to the general clear plan. Otherwise, you have to choose from restricted options. If you make such a mistake maybe you’ll have to change your app in accordance with the chosen monetization scheme at the very last stage.\\n\\n### 2. Carelessness concerning personal data of the users\\n\\nRemember informational safety. Many monetization schemes need personal data, e.g. age, gender, profession. People working with your app want to know how and why their personal data are used. Persuade that yo take care of personal data and explain why you need these data.\\n\\n### 3. Focusing on the ads only\\n\\nAlways think of people’s emotions and ask yourself: what is the right moment for showing ads?\\n\\nBefore creating in-app ads everywhere you should think of what the user feels on each game stage. If the user lost and didn’t get to the next level don’t annoy him with ads. He will hardly click or install something. Better propose him to buy additional in-game items for completing this level. And another user who has won is more likely to click on the ads.\\n\\n### 4. Using only one ads model. \\n\\nThere are many ads choices: banners, native ads, video ads etc. That’s why to use only one ads model is a big mistake. Besides, the users are bored to see only one ads type.\\n\\nIf you use different ads types in your app it helps you to earn more money.\\n\\n### 5. Ignoring metadata\\n\\nSaying “metadata” we mean the information about the users, e.g. their gender, age, income. If you don’t take it into account the users will simply ignore your ads. Why? The businessman will get ads with Barbies and children will be shown ads of the Parker pen.\\n\\n### 6. The same monetization strategy for iOS and Android apps\\n\\nSometimes the app is functioning perfectly on both platforms because you have optimized the program and you took care of every little deal but the ads aren’t effective. \\nThe problem is that the audience on both platforms is different. Users of iOS and Android apps aren’t the same.\\n\\n**The research company app Annie made a research and here are the results:**\\n*1. The app downloads from Play Market exceed these from App Store.*\\n![WORLDWIDE-APP-DOWNLOADS-BY-STORE-Q2-2017](/blog/content/images/2018/11/WORLDWIDE-APP-DOWNLOADS-BY-STORE-Q2-2017.png)\\n\\n*2. Gross Consumer Spend is more by App Store than by Google.*\\n![WORLDWIDE-GROSS-CONSUMER-SPEND--BY-STOREQ22017](/blog/content/images/2018/11/WORLDWIDE-GROSS-CONSUMER-SPEND--BY-STOREQ22017.png)\\n\\nIt means that there are more downloads at Android than at iOS but Apple users are more likely to pay for content in the mobile apps. Remember it when you start developing monetization strategies on both platforms.\\n\\n### 7. Reliance on paid download\\n\\nIt may work for game consoles but on the mobile platform this monetization method is not efficient. Many users prefer to search for an alternative app which they download for free. \\nAs it was mentioned before, there is such model as Freemium where basic options are for free.\\n\\nAnother interesting option is to offer 2 models of the mobile app: one of them is Freemium with ads and another one is prepaid but after payment the user isn’t shown ads. The users are glad to see freedom of choice.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n![conclusion](/blog/content/images/2018/11/conclusion.png)\\nWhen people create a mobile application they always think of monetizing this app. \\n\\nAccording to Statista research, the revenue from mobile apps is growing each year. But not all the apps stay competitive. That’s why you should learn how to monetize your app as much as possible before creating the new product.\\nThere are many types of the monetization and you should know them. The best option is to combine these types.\\n\\nPay attention to the mistakes, which many people make trying to create a successful app. Think of the monetization at the very beginning and not at the end of the development process.\\n\\nYou should take into account that the same monetization strategy for iOS and Android apps is a wrong way.\\n\\nAnd if you want <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[to get help from the skilled team](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u>, we help you in developing an original and interesting mobile app for sure.\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Nowadays people spend a lot of time on their mobile phones, but they rarely decide to pay for the mobile app download.

That’s why the most apps are free and\nhave ads within. So, if you decided to develop an app\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development], there are many points you need\nto consider. And one of them is a monetization.\nYou should think of it long before the app is released.\n\nWhat is an app monetization?  It’s a process of getting money from the mobile\napp without charging for it.\n\nThere are many types of mobile app monetization and several wrong ways which are\npreventing monetization and which you need to avoid. You need to know this\nspecific if you start creating the mobile app.\n\nWorldwide statistic information on mobile app revenues from 2015 to 2020\nThis statistic presents information on mobile app revenues from 2015 to 2020.\nAccording to Statista research  mobile app revenues are growing more and more.\nIn the prediction for 2020, it’ll be twice as big as in 2016.\n\n\nAs you can see, building a mobile app is worth efforts but it’s important to\nmake a market research before and to avoid mistakes. And of course, you should\nthink of the monetization before you have begun building the app.\n\nFirst of all, you should know how to monetize mobile apps and decide which type\nyou should use in your app.\n\nAlso read our article: Top recommendations of successful app name and\ndescription in 2018\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/top-recommendations-of-successful-app-name-and-description-in-2018/]\n\nMobile app monetization strategies\nThere are some types of monetization for mobile applications you need to know\nbefore developing an app. You should get acquainted with all of them and choose\nthe proper ones for your app.\n\n1. In-app advertising\nThere are many in-app advertising types and each of them should be considered\nmore precisely. Here are the main types of ads for mobile applications:\n\n * Playable ads  are mini-games the users can play before they decide to install\n   the full version. They provide users with enjoyable experience.\n * Rewarded video ads  - users get some coins, in-game currency or goods for\n   watching this video.\n * Offerwall  looks like a mini-store and offers some in-game goods in exchange\n   for completing a mini-game/installing an app or other. As usual, these tasks\n   are user-initiated.\n   \n * Interstitial/full-screen ads  - appear when the user is switching between\n   menus. They don’t annoy users because they appear at natural pause in the\n   mobile app and offer clickable images or videos.\n * Video ads  (they are considered not as distracting and annoying as TV ads).\n * Notification ads  usually pop up in the status bar. You should know that\n   these ads are sometimes annoying for users.\n * Banner ads  – they appear on the top or bottom of the screen. Be aware that\n   they can sometimes irritate or distract users and it’s said that banner ads\n   are dying out.\n * Native ads  are similar to banner ads but they blend with the natural mobile\n   environment and the users can’t block them.\n\n2. Freemium\nThe users get basic functions free but they should pay for the whole\nfunctionality. The success of such apps depends on the number of users who are\nready to pay. Be careful: if you give too much of basic functions, nobody will\nbuy the whole functionality and if you give too little, the users refuse using\nthe app because they are forced to pay at once.\n\n3. Subscriptions\nFirstly, the users can test drive the mobile app, read news, but they need to\nsubscribe for some additional materials, reports etc. Usually, the free\nmaterials are restricted and the most interesting things e.g. articles you can\nonly read after payment.\nThe most well-known example is Medium, where you read some articles for free.\n\nAlso read our article: Top Tips for Improving Sales in your App\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/improving-sales-in-your-app/]\n\n4. In-App Purchases (Physical or Virtual Goods)\nSome goods (in-game currencies, new levels or others) are bought by the user,\nalthough the user can stay in the app without buying something.\n\n\n5. Sponsorship\nThe app itself is free but there are offers from the sponsor, e.g. there appears\na video if the user comes to the next level, besides the app owner gets money\nfor each offer.\n\nUsually the app owner and the sponsor have similar goals, for example, the app\nis a fitness app and the offers are sports clothes.\n\n6. Hybrid model.\nWe named this model like that, meaning a model when several monetization ways\nare used in the mobile app.\n\nActually, many models can be blended in the same app. For example, in the same\napp you can make In-App Purchases (buying coins and other special in-game items\nwhich aren’t for free), additionally, there appear the interstitial ads and the\napp offers ads free option, where the user pays a fixed sum and isn’t shown ads\nanymore.\n\nMobile Monetization mistakes you need to avoid\n\n\nPeople creating a mobile app sometimes make mistakes, especially if they are\nbeginners. When you create an app and add advertisement, remember that it\nshouldn’t obscure the fun from the app itself. These ads shouldn’t be shown very\noften and be obtrusive.\n\nThere are some mistakes which should be avoided at the app creation. And of\ncourse, these mistakes prevent monetization, as well. As you know, forewarned is\nforearmed so let’s think of the most common mistakes.\n\n1. Creating monetization scheme at the very last stage of development\nMany people make such a mistake. But if you plan monetization at the development\nbeginning then you can create a mobile app according to the general clear plan.\nOtherwise, you have to choose from restricted options. If you make such a\nmistake maybe you’ll have to change your app in accordance with the chosen\nmonetization scheme at the very last stage.\n\n2. Carelessness concerning personal data of the users\nRemember informational safety. Many monetization schemes need personal data,\ne.g. age, gender, profession. People working with your app want to know how and\nwhy their personal data are used. Persuade that yo take care of personal data\nand explain why you need these data.\n\n3. Focusing on the ads only\nAlways think of people’s emotions and ask yourself: what is the right moment for\nshowing ads?\n\nBefore creating in-app ads everywhere you should think of what the user feels on\neach game stage. If the user lost and didn’t get to the next level don’t annoy\nhim with ads. He will hardly click or install something. Better propose him to\nbuy additional in-game items for completing this level. And another user who has\nwon is more likely to click on the ads.\n\n4. Using only one ads model.\nThere are many ads choices: banners, native ads, video ads etc. That’s why to\nuse only one ads model is a big mistake. Besides, the users are bored to see\nonly one ads type.\n\nIf you use different ads types in your app it helps you to earn more money.\n\n5. Ignoring metadata\nSaying “metadata” we mean the information about the users, e.g. their gender,\nage, income. If you don’t take it into account the users will simply ignore your\nads. Why? The businessman will get ads with Barbies and children will be shown\nads of the Parker pen.\n\n6. The same monetization strategy for iOS and Android apps\nSometimes the app is functioning perfectly on both platforms because you have\noptimized the program and you took care of every little deal but the ads aren’t\neffective.\nThe problem is that the audience on both platforms is different. Users of iOS\nand Android apps aren’t the same.\n\nThe research company app Annie made a research and here are the results:\n1. The app downloads from Play Market exceed these from App Store.\n\n\n2. Gross Consumer Spend is more by App Store than by Google.\n\n\nIt means that there are more downloads at Android than at iOS but Apple users\nare more likely to pay for content in the mobile apps. Remember it when you\nstart developing monetization strategies on both platforms.\n\n7. Reliance on paid download\nIt may work for game consoles but on the mobile platform this monetization\nmethod is not efficient. Many users prefer to search for an alternative app\nwhich they download for free.\nAs it was mentioned before, there is such model as Freemium where basic options\nare for free.\n\nAnother interesting option is to offer 2 models of the mobile app: one of them\nis Freemium with ads and another one is prepaid but after payment the user isn’t\nshown ads. The users are glad to see freedom of choice.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWhen people create a mobile application they always think of monetizing this\napp.\n\nAccording to Statista research, the revenue from mobile apps is growing each\nyear. But not all the apps stay competitive. That’s why you should learn how to\nmonetize your app as much as possible before creating the new product.\nThere are many types of the monetization and you should know them. The best\noption is to combine these types.\n\nPay attention to the mistakes, which many people make trying to create a\nsuccessful app. Think of the monetization at the very beginning and not at the\nend of the development process.\n\nYou should take into account that the same monetization strategy for iOS and\nAndroid apps is a wrong way.\n\nAnd if you want to get help from the skilled team\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts], we help you in developing an original and\ninteresting mobile app for sure.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/11/preview.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"How to monetize your mobile app: best choice for successful startups","meta_description":"Find out what an app monetization is and what are the ways to monetize an app. There are several mobile app revenue models.","author_id":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","created_at":"2018-11-01T15:30:05.000Z","created_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","updated_at":"2019-01-22T10:05:06.000Z","updated_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","published_at":"2018-11-01T16:31:02.000Z","published_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","custom_excerpt":"App monetization is a process of getting money from the mobile app without charging for it.

Children of all ages like mobile apps**\\n\\nKids should be involved in the learning process and what can be better than a bright interactive game. Children aren’t even aware of being taught. They tend to play with their smartphones much more time than to read their coursebooks. This is a good way to complement studies when installing a mobile app. Additionally, kids learning apps inspire new discoveries.\\n\\n*E.g. The learning app Kids Numbers and Math provokes constant interest of the kids and helps to acquire all necessary Math knowledge.*\\n![app-kids-numbers-and-math](/blog/content/images/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-17.10.07.png)\\n\\n**2. Organized systematic learning**\\n\\nA well-designed app offers a clearly organized content which is easy to find and to repeat. And the logical flow helps many students to get used to systematic learning.\\n\\n**3. Available when needed and where needed**\\n\\nMobile apps have a great pro - they are available to all their students all round the clock while school classes and lectures are time-bound. It’s up to you when you decide to open the educational app.\\n\\nIn the car, in the clinic, on holidays -  well, everywhere students can learn from their apps and consult them. You can carry your smartphone everywhere you go!\\n\\n*E.g. LinkedIn Learning offers online courses to learn in-demand business, tech and creative skills and the users can enhance their professionalism wherever they are.*\\n![LinkedIn-Learning-app](/blog/content/images/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-17.11.14.png)\\n\\n**4. Mixing business with pleasure**\\n\\nWhat do people do when they have leisure hours? They often spend time with films, games, internet surfing and it would be a good alternative to replace some of these activities with a learning process. As for kids and teens, they like playing mobile games so why not to offer them an educational app? And concerning getting the knowledge they would surely prefer a smartphone to reading a book.\\n\\n**5. Wider audience**\\n\\nThere exists an opinion that only kids benefit from the learning apps. But adults do it, as well. People of all ages and professions benefit from using educational apps. With some apps, the teachers are able to plan their lessons more efficiently. Parents can instill in kids interest to some subjects. Students have a possibility to prepare for exams etc.\\n\\n**6. Process tracking**\\n\\nMany apps offer such a feature as progress tracking - it’s a clear indication what has already been done and what is ahead of you. And realizing the achievements motivates you for future accomplishments.\\n\\n**7. Innovative learning methods**\\n\\nNew methods, ideas, videos etc. are easily implemented or downloaded into the educational app. No need to buy a lot of books and exercise-books, every innovative feature appears in the smartphone with the new update.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Top recommendations of successful app name and description in 2018](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/top-recommendations-of-successful-app-name-and-description-in-2018/)</b>\\n\\n## Features and Tips essential For Education Apps\\n\\nAs many people are aware of mobile apps benefits, online learning with smartphones is growing more popular. But it relates to competitive apps because well-designed education apps only stand a fair chance in the competitive market. There are definite features of mobile apps you have to pay attention to.\\n\\n**1. “Eye-catching” content.**\\n\\nChildren quickly get bored and need to move from one activity to another. You need to capture their attention if you really want to create an interesting educational app for kids. The learning process should look like a game and adding cartoon characters as guides would be a pro. Another advantage is vibrant colors. And remember to create the app content in the very simple language so that every child understands what’s required. The info appearing in the app should be simple and short.\\n\\n*E.g. Duolingo is using attractive vibrant colors and offers fun lessons:*\\n![duolingo-app_crown_levels](/blog/content/images/2018/11/duolingo_crown_levels.0.jpg)\\n\\nBut the best educational apps for kids are not always the best educational apps for teens.\\n\\nIf your target audience is teens the strategy should be different! Think what is interesting for teens, what is cool right now. The color scheme of the app becomes more and more important and should differ from the previous section because of many reasons, e.g. teen boys will hardly download a pink learning app. Teens and adults aren’t tolerant concerning bugs and start searching for another app very quickly.\\n\\nRemember to put video content in the right place. As they say, better once to see, than hundred times to hear. E. g. if the app teaches photography and makes clear tricks of the light it’s better to create one video with light tricks than to write much text explanation.\\n\\n**2. Gamification**\\n\\nChildren usually gain knowledge within the game. The same works for teens and adults. It doesn’t matter which subject is taught with help of the app. A learning app will be more attractive both for adults and for kids if you add mini-games, make the tests look like games, add rewards. Then it’ll provide a delightful experience.\\n\\n**3. Step by step learning process**\\n\\nDivide the “big knowledge” into short-term tasks. Firstly people will have enough time to complete such short exercises, secondly, it’s not as difficult to solve little tasks as to learn much information at once.\\n\\nIncrease the level of complexity gradually from task to task. If you make it complicated at once the users are more likely to abandon the learning app.\\n\\n**4. Clear User Interface**\\n\\nThe login/signup form should be short and the important features of an educational app should become clear within 5 minutes. You need to know: if the users have to wade through your learning app, they lose interest. Especially kids, they just abandon using the app.\\n\\nAdditionally, the app will get low ratings in the App Store and Play Market and as you know there are too many competitive apps which can replace yours.\\n\\n**5. Regular Update**\\n\\nRemember that your content has to be updated regularly for holding interest of both adults and children. Think of actual videos, facts and something fascinating your app can be updated with.\\n\\nFor example, the app offers studying a foreign language. It’s divided into parts “family,” “animals,” “flat” etc. You may add new levels to the app; new mini-games etc.\\n\\n**6. Live Tutorials**\\n\\nIt can be an additional competitive feature for students. One can’t ask questions when using a non-interactive application but such tutorials provide live interactions with professional tutors what enhances the learning process. The pupils clear any doubts and may get such info which is not present in the app.\\n\\n**7. Tests, achievements and rewards**\\n\\nTo watch the progress is important both for kids and for adults. When you realize that you’ve managed so much it’s really motivating. Tests can look like a fun game with rewards. Be aware that children would have fun from getting beautiful medals or gathering stars. Adults would like to estimate their progress and achievements.\\n\\n*E.g. Memrise offers a leaderboard and every user can compare his achievements with the others:*\\n![memrise-app-leaderboard](/blog/content/images/2018/11/image.png)\\n\\n**8. Categories for lessons on different topics**\\n\\nLectures shouldn’t be all mixed up. Comprehensive content should be divided clearly and different topics should be situated so that students realize the clear division of a learning system. If the user needs to repeat something he should be offered easy navigation to find that category he needs.\\n\\n**9. Integration with social networks.**\\n\\nThere is no need to say that almost all educational mobile apps incorporate social media. The best educational apps remember to announce updates and new content on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. And YouTube is the right place to make your content easily accessible to your users in a mobile-friendly format. As kids and teens spend much time in social networks, the best educational apps use social media to attract new users.\\n\\n**10. Individual Configurations**\\n\\nUsing an individual approach is always better than the same configuration mode for everybody. It is one of the features of an app which makes users feel more comfortable. The language learning apps often offer such choices as numbers of repetitions, preferred quiz mode, learning speed etc.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n\\nThe world has changed and the educational methods have changed, as well. Such a great amount of learning tools had never existed before. Nowadays with smartphones, we can learn everywhere, anytime and choose that method which fits exactly us. Both prepaid and free educational apps are a great complement to the old school. A well-designed mobile app contains features involving users in the interesting discovery game, there is no boring cumbersome content, instead of it the achievements are awarded and people are being motivated.\\n\\nActually, mobile learning industry is gaining strength and more and more competitive apps come to the mobile market. If you are an experienced entrepreneur you manage to install your app in the first place. If fostering competitiveness a new app is hard to do by your own, you can get started <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[an educational app development](https://2muchcoffee.com/education-app)</b></u> with our 2muchcoffee team!\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><blockquote>\n<p>Tell me and I forget,<br>\nteach me and I may remember,<br>\ninvolve me and I learn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Benjamin Franklin</em></p>\n<p>Education has always been an important foundation for future achievements and people have been interested in learning new subjects, languages, and information.

There is no need to say that a good education is crucial in the\nfuture career. But the problem is that most adult people are always in a hurry\nand can’t spend many hours for classes.\n\nAs for teens and kids, they consider studies as a really boring process. In\naddition to it, severe teachers and difficult testings sometimes discourage\nlearning. So how to make this process interesting? How to interest children in\ngetting new knowledge?\n\nThe solution is already found. When kids install the educational app the game\nprocess involves them and they aren’t even aware that in addition to the game\nthey are learning. And adult people get an opportunity to learn using a limited\nperiod of time e.g. short coffee-breaks.\n\nAlso read our article: Guide on the Educational App Creation\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/guide-on-the-educational-app-creation/]\n\nBenefits from mobile apps for education\n\n\nMobile apps are able to teach in innovative ways and bring in a great number of\nbenefits for kids and adults.\n\nThere are many competitive apps in the mobile app market: remote tuition\nplatforms, language learning, mobile apps for kids etc. Let’s think of benefits\nfrom top educational apps:\n\n1. Children of all ages like mobile apps\n\nKids should be involved in the learning process and what can be better than a\nbright interactive game. Children aren’t even aware of being taught. They tend\nto play with their smartphones much more time than to read their coursebooks.\nThis is a good way to complement studies when installing a mobile app.\nAdditionally, kids learning apps inspire new discoveries.\n\nE.g. The learning app Kids Numbers and Math provokes constant interest of the\nkids and helps to acquire all necessary Math knowledge.\n\n\n2. Organized systematic learning\n\nA well-designed app offers a clearly organized content which is easy to find and\nto repeat. And the logical flow helps many students to get used to systematic\nlearning.\n\n3. Available when needed and where needed\n\nMobile apps have a great pro - they are available to all their students all\nround the clock while school classes and lectures are time-bound. It’s up to you\nwhen you decide to open the educational app.\n\nIn the car, in the clinic, on holidays - well, everywhere students can learn\nfrom their apps and consult them. You can carry your smartphone everywhere you\ngo!\n\nE.g. LinkedIn Learning offers online courses to learn in-demand business, tech\nand creative skills and the users can enhance their professionalism wherever\nthey are.\n\n\n4. Mixing business with pleasure\n\nWhat do people do when they have leisure hours? They often spend time with\nfilms, games, internet surfing and it would be a good alternative to replace\nsome of these activities with a learning process. As for kids and teens, they\nlike playing mobile games so why not to offer them an educational app? And\nconcerning getting the knowledge they would surely prefer a smartphone to\nreading a book.\n\n5. Wider audience\n\nThere exists an opinion that only kids benefit from the learning apps. But\nadults do it, as well. People of all ages and professions benefit from using\neducational apps. With some apps, the teachers are able to plan their lessons\nmore efficiently. Parents can instill in kids interest to some subjects.\nStudents have a possibility to prepare for exams etc.\n\n6. Process tracking\n\nMany apps offer such a feature as progress tracking - it’s a clear indication\nwhat has already been done and what is ahead of you. And realizing the\nachievements motivates you for future accomplishments.\n\n7. Innovative learning methods\n\nNew methods, ideas, videos etc. are easily implemented or downloaded into the\neducational app. No need to buy a lot of books and exercise-books, every\ninnovative feature appears in the smartphone with the new update.\n\nAlso read our article: Top recommendations of successful app name and\ndescription in 2018\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/top-recommendations-of-successful-app-name-and-description-in-2018/]\n\nFeatures and Tips essential For Education Apps\nAs many people are aware of mobile apps benefits, online learning with\nsmartphones is growing more popular. But it relates to competitive apps because\nwell-designed education apps only stand a fair chance in the competitive market.\nThere are definite features of mobile apps you have to pay attention to.\n\n1. “Eye-catching” content.\n\nChildren quickly get bored and need to move from one activity to another. You\nneed to capture their attention if you really want to create an interesting\neducational app for kids. The learning process should look like a game and\nadding cartoon characters as guides would be a pro. Another advantage is vibrant\ncolors. And remember to create the app content in the very simple language so\nthat every child understands what’s required. The info appearing in the app\nshould be simple and short.\n\nE.g. Duolingo is using attractive vibrant colors and offers fun lessons:\n\n\nBut the best educational apps for kids are not always the best educational apps\nfor teens.\n\nIf your target audience is teens the strategy should be different! Think what is\ninteresting for teens, what is cool right now. The color scheme of the app\nbecomes more and more important and should differ from the previous section\nbecause of many reasons, e.g. teen boys will hardly download a pink learning\napp. Teens and adults aren’t tolerant concerning bugs and start searching for\nanother app very quickly.\n\nRemember to put video content in the right place. As they say, better once to\nsee, than hundred times to hear. E. g. if the app teaches photography and makes\nclear tricks of the light it’s better to create one video with light tricks than\nto write much text explanation.\n\n2. Gamification\n\nChildren usually gain knowledge within the game. The same works for teens and\nadults. It doesn’t matter which subject is taught with help of the app. A\nlearning app will be more attractive both for adults and for kids if you add\nmini-games, make the tests look like games, add rewards. Then it’ll provide a\ndelightful experience.\n\n3. Step by step learning process\n\nDivide the “big knowledge” into short-term tasks. Firstly people will have\nenough time to complete such short exercises, secondly, it’s not as difficult to\nsolve little tasks as to learn much information at once.\n\nIncrease the level of complexity gradually from task to task. If you make it\ncomplicated at once the users are more likely to abandon the learning app.\n\n4. Clear User Interface\n\nThe login/signup form should be short and the important features of an\neducational app should become clear within 5 minutes. You need to know: if the\nusers have to wade through your learning app, they lose interest. Especially\nkids, they just abandon using the app.\n\nAdditionally, the app will get low ratings in the App Store and Play Market and\nas you know there are too many competitive apps which can replace yours.\n\n5. Regular Update\n\nRemember that your content has to be updated regularly for holding interest of\nboth adults and children. Think of actual videos, facts and something\nfascinating your app can be updated with.\n\nFor example, the app offers studying a foreign language. It’s divided into parts\n“family,” “animals,” “flat” etc. You may add new levels to the app; new\nmini-games etc.\n\n6. Live Tutorials\n\nIt can be an additional competitive feature for students. One can’t ask\nquestions when using a non-interactive application but such tutorials provide\nlive interactions with professional tutors what enhances the learning process.\nThe pupils clear any doubts and may get such info which is not present in the\napp.\n\n7. Tests, achievements and rewards\n\nTo watch the progress is important both for kids and for adults. When you\nrealize that you’ve managed so much it’s really motivating. Tests can look like\na fun game with rewards. Be aware that children would have fun from getting\nbeautiful medals or gathering stars. Adults would like to estimate their\nprogress and achievements.\n\nE.g. Memrise offers a leaderboard and every user can compare his achievements\nwith the others:\n\n\n8. Categories for lessons on different topics\n\nLectures shouldn’t be all mixed up. Comprehensive content should be divided\nclearly and different topics should be situated so that students realize the\nclear division of a learning system. If the user needs to repeat something he\nshould be offered easy navigation to find that category he needs.\n\n9. Integration with social networks.\n\nThere is no need to say that almost all educational mobile apps incorporate\nsocial media. The best educational apps remember to announce updates and new\ncontent on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. And YouTube is the right place to\nmake your content easily accessible to your users in a mobile-friendly format.\nAs kids and teens spend much time in social networks, the best educational apps\nuse social media to attract new users.\n\n10. Individual Configurations\n\nUsing an individual approach is always better than the same configuration mode\nfor everybody. It is one of the features of an app which makes users feel more\ncomfortable. The language learning apps often offer such choices as numbers of\nrepetitions, preferred quiz mode, learning speed etc.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe world has changed and the educational methods have changed, as well.

Let’s consider the following mistakes more precisely.\\n\\n### 1. No target audience and no market research\\n\\nBefore developing an app you have to make a market research and to study competitors, otherwise, the app probably is bound to fail.\\nAre you solving a users’ problem with your app or do you just want to earn money? Survey your target audience and find out its needs. Ask yourself what will drive the people to use your app over others. You have to get an understanding of what the users need, how old they are, what they like and <a name=\\\"3\\\"></a>dislike. The mobile app for little girls and for businessmen has to be different. Otherwise, you risk to waste money and time for the product and then to find out the apps like this one are a dime a dozen.\\n\\n\\n### 2.  Creating a trivial app \\n\\nAs follows from the above-mentioned, the app shouldn’t be banal, it has to include unique features and one core feature. Some product owners succumbed to the temptation of copy-pasting old ideas and software tool elements into their new app. As you understand, it hasn't done any good. \\n<a name=\\\"4\\\"></a>The app offering nothing special is neither competitive nor interesting enough while the competitive mobile app has to be unique and to solve customer needs. \\n\\n### 3. Too many features, unclear UI\\n\\nRemember, the interface has both to be clear and to provide many features. If you can hardly create an attractive mobile app UI design by your own think of hiring someone who specializes in interface design.\\n\\n**Features.** The features added to the app must be useful but don’t overload the app with extra features, they distract and annoy users. It is a mistake if you don’t separate core features from additional ones. There is an option to add core and the most necessary features at once and some of the additional features - later in a future update.\\n\\n**Sign in.** When the user has to sign in/sign up he would rather write his name and email address than fill long registration forms. Integrate it with social media and people can login through their social media profiles. \\nWasting a lot of time for filling a form, looking at splash animated screens or at interface elements/ads which block the content - all of them are irritating users. Of course, they can download such an app but abandon using it after some time.\\n\\n**Icons and interactive elements.** Additionally, I’d like to mention mistakes at creating intuitive icons and interactive graphical elements. The standard icons have come into existence after long years of testing and they have become a global identity because of their user-friendliness.\\nFor example, you are developing an online shop. The shopping cart in online shops usually has a definite icon and place; the search field is usually placed on top, etc. If you make everything different trying to create the best UI design, the users first have to comprehend things that they are not <a name=\\\"5\\\"></a>interested to do. Even if they continue using your app, new icons and elements will distract them from their main goal: shopping. That’s why think first, if it’s a good idea to change all usual elements for new ones.\\n\\n### 4. Launching a mobile app on too many platforms\\n\\nPlanning to launch your app on all the existing platforms is a great mistake if you don’t have limitless resources. Firstly, it’ll take a lot of time and money. Secondly, depending on the goal of your app and your target audience one platform is more preferable than the others. That’s why the first thing you need to do is to spend time on researching and understanding which platform meets your needs.\\n\\n#### Statistics of Android and iOS popularity  by country at the global level\\n![MAP-Statistics of Android and iOS popularity  by country at the global level](/blog/content/images/2018/11/MAP.png)\\n\\nMy advice is you should not be wasted on all the platforms at once. It’s better to develop an app on the leading platforms - Android and iOS. You should start developing apps for Android if you plan to market them in Asia and Eastern Europe and for iOS if the apps are created for the USA and Western Europe. \\n\\niOS is usually chosen for paid apps models and Android - for the free ones. Besides, you should find out about particularities, pros and cons concerning launching on each platform.\\n\\nSo you have to do the research and to learn which countries your main users belong to. The choice of the platform must depend on it. Of course, after the <a name=\\\"6\\\"></a>initial release on the first platform, you can roll out your mobile app to the other platforms a few months later. \\n\\nAnother option is to develop a cross-platform application with Ionic and to launch in on both platforms.\\n\\n### 5. Lack of marketing\\n\\nIt’s one of the common mistakes. There are product owners which have got an idea, they try to develop an app as much as possible, invest their time and money, and then they start thinking of marketing strategies. Of course, it’s too late.\\n\\n*You’d better start promoting the app before it’s released because:*\\n* You comprehend whether it’s interesting for users if there is a demand\\n* You create an audience of potential users which are ready to download it.\\n\\nNow think what you will offer the users: maybe some fascinating screens of the app or a video (it can be interactive when the user is performing some actions). \\n\\n<a name=\\\"7\\\"></a>Many product owners try to gloss over some aspects of their apps; on the entrepreneur side, this is quite understandable. But it’s a mistake to make such specific ads after which the users download the app and comprehend: it totally differs from its demo version.\\n\\n### 6. Forgetting about additional cost.\\n\\nWhen developing an app, don’t count with immediate profit. First of all, bear in mind that despite expenses for development there are many other hidden costs. You’ll have to invest in ads, you will add content or features when updating your app.\\n\\nPublishing an app on Apple App Store costs $99 per year and additionally, there is a transaction fee in 15%. In Google Play the fee is $25 for the registration, and the transaction fee is 30%. But for subscriptions this fee decreases to 15% in the second and following paid years. \\n\\nIf the users need to store data, e.g. videos and photos, you’ll have to pay for the cloud data storage. \\n<a name=\\\"8\\\"></a>\\nRemember costs for the app maintenance: you’ll need to fix bugs, to solve problems, to add features. Maintenance costs usually take 20% of app's total budget annually.\\n\\n### 7. Forgetting Monetization\\n\\nSurely, every product owner is waiting for getting a return on his/her investment. That’s why it’s crucial to decide how to monetize an app.\\n\\nMonetization strategy has to be thought at the preparatory stage, not after having developed the app. When you incorporate your monetization strategy into your app at the beginning you are able to create it according to the general clear plan. If you don’t do it then you’ll choose from restricted options. If this strategy is implemented in a wrong way it’ll negatively impact the user experience.\\n\\nSo, our advice is: learn about all possible models of the monetization and decide which one to use or which ones to combine. Also, learn about the most common monetization mistakes.\\n<a name=\\\"9\\\"></a>\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Here’s an article where you find the needed info: [How to monetize your mobile app: best choice for successful startups](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-monetize-your-mobile-app/)</b>\\n\\n## Mistakes at the final stage\\n![MISTAKES-AT-THE-FINAL-STAGE-of mobile app development](/blog/content/images/2018/11/MISTAKES-AT-THE-FINAL-STAGE.png)\\n\\n<a name=\\\"10\\\"></a>Other mistakes happen at the late stage, when the mobile app is being tested and when it’s released. Unfortunately many product owners just want to build the app and forget that users should stay interested in it for a longer period. So let’s look at the mistakes at the final stage.\\n\\n### 1. No testing stage\\n\\nSome product owners and developers are in a hurry to release the app but remember the quality is important! \\n\\nAfter your app is ready it’s time to start testing, not release. This stage discovers problems with the app and catches bugs. It’s a must that the mobile app is tested thoroughly on many popular devices. \\n\\nBear in mind it’s up to you whether you find some mistakes and problems or whether the users encounter these bugs.\\n<a name=\\\"11\\\"></a>\\nThe app should be tested on different devices and OS versions. Remember the beta testing after which additional problems are expected to emerge. You let people try your app out and then you get feedback and improve, improve… \\n\\n### 2. No updates of the existing app\\n\\nAfter release, the app is downloaded by many users and they have fun with it. But there can be little expectation that you won’t devote time to the app after release and it’ll make a lot of money constantly.\\n\\nIf it’s a game the users pass all the levels and what’s next? Adding new levels, characters will refresh the users’ interest. The learning app may get <a name=\\\"12\\\"></a>new topics or videos.\\n\\nRetention is important because updates hold interest. You succeed if your app is not only downloaded but used repeatedly. You should find out why users drop off the app and focus on drumming up their interest.\\n\\n### 3. Ignoring Negative Feedback\\n\\nMuch work has to be done before the release but it should be understood, however: just to release an app is not enough, your job is far from over and these are comments that will guide you. \\n\\nThe positive feedback helps to understand what is done correctly, and one-star reviews are valuable because they point the way of improving. It happens rather often that the users point to some mistakes of the app and the product owner isn’t there. Will this app get on top? Will people repeatedly use it? \\n<a name=\\\"13\\\"></a>\\nFix or change features the users dislike and comment that you have taken their opinion into account. After the release you have to support and to make things better, not to forget about your creation.\\n\\n### 4. Failing to fix bugs \\n\\nThere is no way that some app doesn’t have bugs. They are just part of apps life. But it’s a must of developers to fix bugs quickly. Major bugs have to be fixed as fast as possible as the users aren’t willing to endure them while minor bugs may be able to wait.  \\n\\nAll the time your apps are in the market you should be keeping an eye on problems and bugs, appearing in them. Figure out what is wrong and release an update. Don’t forget to claim in it that you removed such-and-such bugs.\\n\\nRemember that the main goal is a repeated use. Otherwise, it’ll be very difficult to bring back the audience. \\n<a name=\\\"14\\\"></a>\\nAll the lifecycle of your app has to consist of updates, new releases and a lot of bug-fixing. As a result, you’ll get the grateful audience and stable revenue.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n![CONCLUSION](/blog/content/images/2018/11/CONCLUSION.png)\\n\\nBuilding a mobile app is a lot of work and it shouldn’t be treated carelessly. It’s not a development stage that comes at the beginning, it’s a research, analysing, making decisions, promotion and consulting. If you haven’t done it you risk failing. The users have too many choices of mobile apps and you must be interested in fostering the competitiveness of your app. \\n\\nWhen the app is ready it’s time to test it. After the initial release your job is not over, remember the support, bug-fixing etc. Only in this case the users won’t abandon the downloaded app. Your goal is that they keep using the mobile app.\\n\\n**If you are searching for skilled developers to <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[create your mobile app](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development)</b></u>, our team is always ready to help you.**\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>If you are reading this article I suggest you want to build a mobile app. And for sure, you want to avoid common mistakes many companies and developers make.</p>\n<p>As you know there are really many mobile apps in the market but less than 1% of apps will be considered financial successes.

Let’s consider the following mistakes more precisely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1notargetaudienceandnomarketresearch\">1. No target audience and no market research</h3>\n<p>Before developing an app you have to make a market research and to study competitors, otherwise, the app probably is bound to fail.<br>\nAre you solving a users’ problem with your app or do you just want to earn money? Survey your target audience and find out its needs. Ask yourself what will drive the people to use your app over others. You have to get an understanding of what the users need, how old they are, what they like and <a name=\"3\"></a>dislike. The mobile app for little girls and for businessmen has to be different. Otherwise, you risk to waste money and time for the product and then to find out the apps like this one are a dime a dozen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2creatingatrivialapp\">2.  Creating a trivial app</h3>\n<p>As follows from the above-mentioned, the app shouldn’t be banal, it has to include unique features and one core feature. Some product owners succumbed to the temptation of copy-pasting old ideas and software tool elements into their new app. As you understand, it hasn't done any good.<br>\n<a name=\"4\"></a>The app offering nothing special is neither competitive nor interesting enough while the competitive mobile app has to be unique and to solve customer needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3toomanyfeaturesunclearui\">3. Too many features, unclear UI</h3>\n<p>Remember, the interface has both to be clear and to provide many features. If you can hardly create an attractive mobile app UI design by your own think of hiring someone who specializes in interface design.</p>\n<p><strong>Features.</strong> The features added to the app must be useful but don’t overload the app with extra features, they distract and annoy users. It is a mistake if you don’t separate core features from additional ones. There is an option to add core and the most necessary features at once and some of the additional features - later in a future update.</p>\n<p><strong>Sign in.</strong> When the user has to sign in/sign up he would rather write his name and email address than fill long registration forms. Integrate it with social media and people can login through their social media profiles.<br>\nWasting a lot of time for filling a form, looking at splash animated screens or at interface elements/ads which block the content - all of them are irritating users. Of course, they can download such an app but abandon using it after some time.</p>\n<p><strong>Icons and interactive elements.</strong> Additionally, I’d like to mention mistakes at creating intuitive icons and interactive graphical elements. The standard icons have come into existence after long years of testing and they have become a global identity because of their user-friendliness.<br>\nFor example, you are developing an online shop. The shopping cart in online shops usually has a definite icon and place; the search field is usually placed on top, etc. If you make everything different trying to create the best UI design, the users first have to comprehend things that they are not <a name=\"5\"></a>interested to do. Even if they continue using your app, new icons and elements will distract them from their main goal: shopping. That’s why think first, if it’s a good idea to change all usual elements for new ones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4launchingamobileappontoomanyplatforms\">4. Launching a mobile app on too many platforms</h3>\n<p>Planning to launch your app on all the existing platforms is a great mistake if you don’t have limitless resources. Firstly, it’ll take a lot of time and money. Secondly, depending on the goal of your app and your target audience one platform is more preferable than the others. That’s why the first thing you need to do is to spend time on researching and understanding which platform meets your needs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"statisticsofandroidandiospopularitybycountryatthegloballevel\">Statistics of Android and iOS popularity  by country at the global level</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/11/MAP.png\" alt=\"MAP-Statistics of Android and iOS popularity  by country at the global level\"></p>\n<p>My advice is you should not be wasted on all the platforms at once. It’s better to develop an app on the leading platforms - Android and iOS. You should start developing apps for Android if you plan to market them in Asia and Eastern Europe and for iOS if the apps are created for the USA and Western Europe.</p>\n<p>iOS is usually chosen for paid apps models and Android - for the free ones. Besides, you should find out about particularities, pros and cons concerning launching on each platform.</p>\n<p>So you have to do the research and to learn which countries your main users belong to. The choice of the platform must depend on it. Of course, after the <a name=\"6\"></a>initial release on the first platform, you can roll out your mobile app to the other platforms a few months later.</p>\n<p>Another option is to develop a cross-platform application with Ionic and to launch in on both platforms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5lackofmarketing\">5. Lack of marketing</h3>\n<p>It’s one of the common mistakes. There are product owners which have got an idea, they try to develop an app as much as possible, invest their time and money, and then they start thinking of marketing strategies. Of course, it’s too late.</p>\n<p><em>You’d better start promoting the app before it’s released because:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You comprehend whether it’s interesting for users if there is a demand</li>\n<li>You create an audience of potential users which are ready to download it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now think what you will offer the users: maybe some fascinating screens of the app or a video (it can be interactive when the user is performing some actions).</p>\n<p><a name=\"7\"></a>Many product owners try to gloss over some aspects of their apps; on the entrepreneur side, this is quite understandable. But it’s a mistake to make such specific ads after which the users download the app and comprehend: it totally differs from its demo version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6forgettingaboutadditionalcost\">6. Forgetting about additional cost.</h3>\n<p>When developing an app, don’t count with immediate profit. First of all, bear in mind that despite expenses for development there are many other hidden costs. You’ll have to invest in ads, you will add content or features when updating your app.</p>\n<p>Publishing an app on Apple App Store costs $99 per year and additionally, there is a transaction fee in 15%. In Google Play the fee is $25 for the registration, and the transaction fee is 30%. But for subscriptions this fee decreases to 15% in the second and following paid years.</p>\n<p>If the users need to store data, e.g. videos and photos, you’ll have to pay for the cloud data storage.<br>\n<a name=\"8\"></a><br>\nRemember costs for the app maintenance: you’ll need to fix bugs, to solve problems, to add features. Maintenance costs usually take 20% of app's total budget annually.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7forgettingmonetization\">7. Forgetting Monetization</h3>\n<p>Surely, every product owner is waiting for getting a return on his/her investment. That’s why it’s crucial to decide how to monetize an app.</p>\n<p>Monetization strategy has to be thought at the preparatory stage, not after having developed the app. When you incorporate your monetization strategy into your app at the beginning you are able to create it according to the general clear plan. If you don’t do it then you’ll choose from restricted options. If this strategy is implemented in a wrong way it’ll negatively impact the user experience.</p>\n<p>So, our advice is: learn about all possible models of the monetization and decide which one to use or which ones to combine. Also, learn about the most common monetization mistakes.<br>\n<a name=\"9\"></a><br>\n<b style=\"background-color:#CCF0EB\">Here’s an article where you find the needed info: <a href=\"https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-monetize-your-mobile-app/\">How to monetize your mobile app: best choice for successful startups</a></b></p>\n<h2 id=\"mistakesatthefinalstage\">Mistakes at the final stage</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/11/MISTAKES-AT-THE-FINAL-STAGE.png\" alt=\"MISTAKES-AT-THE-FINAL-STAGE-of mobile app development\"></p>\n<p><a name=\"10\"></a>Other mistakes happen at the late stage, when the mobile app is being tested and when it’s released. Unfortunately many product owners just want to build the app and forget that users should stay interested in it for a longer period. So let’s look at the mistakes at the final stage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1notestingstage\">1. No testing stage</h3>\n<p>Some product owners and developers are in a hurry to release the app but remember the quality is important!</p>\n<p>After your app is ready it’s time to start testing, not release. This stage discovers problems with the app and catches bugs. It’s a must that the mobile app is tested thoroughly on many popular devices.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind it’s up to you whether you find some mistakes and problems or whether the users encounter these bugs.<br>\n<a name=\"11\"></a><br>\nThe app should be tested on different devices and OS versions. Remember the beta testing after which additional problems are expected to emerge. You let people try your app out and then you get feedback and improve, improve…</p>\n<h3 id=\"2noupdatesoftheexistingapp\">2. No updates of the existing app</h3>\n<p>After release, the app is downloaded by many users and they have fun with it. But there can be little expectation that you won’t devote time to the app after release and it’ll make a lot of money constantly.</p>\n<p>If it’s a game the users pass all the levels and what’s next? Adding new levels, characters will refresh the users’ interest. The learning app may get <a name=\"12\"></a>new topics or videos.</p>\n<p>Retention is important because updates hold interest. You succeed if your app is not only downloaded but used repeatedly. You should find out why users drop off the app and focus on drumming up their interest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3ignoringnegativefeedback\">3. Ignoring Negative Feedback</h3>\n<p>Much work has to be done before the release but it should be understood, however: just to release an app is not enough, your job is far from over and these are comments that will guide you.</p>\n<p>The positive feedback helps to understand what is done correctly, and one-star reviews are valuable because they point the way of improving. It happens rather often that the users point to some mistakes of the app and the product owner isn’t there. Will this app get on top? Will people repeatedly use it?<br>\n<a name=\"13\"></a><br>\nFix or change features the users dislike and comment that you have taken their opinion into account. After the release you have to support and to make things better, not to forget about your creation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4failingtofixbugs\">4. Failing to fix bugs</h3>\n<p>There is no way that some app doesn’t have bugs. They are just part of apps life. But it’s a must of developers to fix bugs quickly. Major bugs have to be fixed as fast as possible as the users aren’t willing to endure them while minor bugs may be able to wait.</p>\n<p>All the time your apps are in the market you should be keeping an eye on problems and bugs, appearing in them. Figure out what is wrong and release an update. Don’t forget to claim in it that you removed such-and-such bugs.</p>\n<p>Remember that the main goal is a repeated use. Otherwise, it’ll be very difficult to bring back the audience.<br>\n<a name=\"14\"></a><br>\nAll the lifecycle of your app has to consist of updates, new releases and a lot of bug-fixing. As a result, you’ll get the grateful audience and stable revenue.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/11/CONCLUSION.png\" alt=\"CONCLUSION\"></p>\n<p>Building a mobile app is a lot of work and it shouldn’t be treated carelessly. It’s not a development stage that comes at the beginning, it’s a research, analysing, making decisions, promotion and consulting. If you haven’t done it you risk failing. The users have too many choices of mobile apps and you must be interested in fostering the competitiveness of your app.</p>\n<p>When the app is ready it’s time to test it.

Indeed, this tool allows the developer to improve the efficiency of working with the project significantly. The possibilities of Angular CLI encompass the creation of a new project, the adjustment of its parameters, the addition of new features to the project, serving and much more. To use these features it is necessary to install Node.js v8.9 or higher and NPM v5.5.1 or higher in the system. Next, you should install Angular CLI to the system globally with the next command:\\n\\n> **npm install -g @angular/cli**\\n\\nAfter that, Angular CLI will be available for use. Here is an example of commands for creating and running a development server for the new Angular application:\\n\\n> **ng new new-project-name\\n> cd new-project-name\\n> ng serve**\\n\\nFull information can be found on the official website (https://cli.angular.io/).\\n\\n#### SASS (https://sass-lang.com/)\\nAnother best practice of Angular development is using SASS for components styling. Firstly, there is a lot of well-known benefits of using it: variables, mixins, functions, etc. Secondly, SASS preprocessor is the default for many popular 3rd-party-libraries for Angular, such as Material Components, which also use it to manage the themes of the design. By default, when a new project is created using Angular CLI, it sets CSS for styling. \\nTo set SASS as default for it you need to run the next command:\\n\\n> **ng new new-project-name --style=scss**\\n\\n#### Angular Dependency Injection\\nWhen Angular 7 came, it brought a new way to provide injectable services. Earlier services have been provided in *NgModule only (preferably in the Core module)*. Now, when a new service is generated with Angular CLI, it is automatically provided in the root module, using \\\"provideIn\\\" key of *@Injectable()* decorator.\\n\\n```javascript\\n@Injectable({\\n  \\tprovidedIn: 'root'\\n})\\n```\\n\\n*\\\"Root\\\"* is the default value which was sat by Angular CLI and could be replaced with any NgModule of application.\\n\\n#### RxJs (https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/)\\nRxJs is difficult to learn and to understand. But Angular widely uses it. In order to apply the methods of reactive programming successfully, the developer should start thinking in terms of streams, not actions. And as soon as you study the basic capabilities of RxJs, you will see all the advantages of the reactive approach and understand why this library plays such a significant role in the Angular framework. \\n\\nBriefly, it uses an observer pattern that involves the presence of a certain subject and a number of observers. The observers subscribe to the subject events (change of state), and when it happens, they respond by calling their methods. Ultimately, RxJs makes it possible to create a more readable and maintainable code.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Optimization of the Angular 2+ app download speed](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-optimize-the-angular-app-download-speed/)</b>\\n\\n## 2. Project structure recommendations\\n\\nFor best maintenance, Angular projects have a typical project structure, components naming and must comply with the uniform rules. These rules have been written in details by Angular Team in the Style Guide section of the Official Website (https://angular.io/guide/styleguide). They affect both the names of components, services, resolvers, directives, pipes, and their joint organization within a single project. Let us talk about one of the most useful recommendations for project organization.\\n\\nFirst of all, we have to create a correct structure of *Angular modules*. In the style guide, we can read about the app, shared, core and feature modules.\\n\\n*App module* - the main (root) module of every Angular application. The existence of this module is defined by the philosophy of Angular, which says, the application has to have at least one root module.\\n\\n*Core module* - another significant module of the Angular application. It is used for importing 3rd-party-libraries, providing singleton services, etc. In general, the Core modules should make the App module more readable, taking over part of the functional.\\n\\nThe purpose of the *Shared module* is for import and re-exporting reusable components, pipes, directives, and Angular modules, which could be used many times. Using it, you can get rid of the need to import a number of modules into the module of some features, importing instead only one Shared module.\\n\\nAlso, the Angular team recommends creating its own *feature modules* for each independent feature. This makes the project easily supported, allows you to formalize the structure of components more accurately and to make the component available for lazy loading.\\n\\n## 3. Performance recommendations\\n![performance](/blog/content/images/2018/11/performance.png)\\n\\nAngular since version 2+ gives developers a wonderful opportunity to use lazy loading modules. Its mechanism involves downloading the component modules as they become necessary as a result of the user's routing navigation. Using lazy loading allows developers to minimize the size of the originally downloaded application, limiting them to only those components, that are used on the page which is loaded. All other components that are available by routing will be lazily loaded after navigating the corresponding routing. In cases with large scalable projects, this approach gives a significant gain in application performance and minifies download time.\\n\\nBelow there is an example of a code that describes the routing configuration with a lazy loaded Products module.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst routes: Routes = [\\n  \\t{\\n    \\t\\tpath: 'products',\\n    \\t\\tloadChildren: 'app/products/products.module#ProductsModule'\\n \\t }\\n];\\n```\\n\\nAnother way to get the best performance of the Angular application is production build. Angular CLI only generates a development build script (with \\\"ng build\\\" script) when generating a new project by default. To get more productive build we have to add to *package.json* next script:\\n\\n```javascript\\n\\\"build:prod\\\": \\\"ng build --prod --build-optimizer --vendor-chunk\\\" \\n```\\n\\nThese flags modify a lot of build options for minifying and optimizing output build.

With the internet you can do everything: order a pizza, sell old clothes, buy a new laptop etc.\\n\\nThe birth of the internet happened at the very start of 1983, but E-commerce began when the first man sold goods through the World Wide Web.\\n\\n## E-commerce Definition\\n\\nBefore telling the history of <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[e-commerce development](https://2muchcoffee.com/ecommerce-saas)</b></u> let’s define what it means.\\n\\n*E-commerce (electronic commerce or internet commerce)* is commercial transactions via the internet - buying and selling goods. \\n\\nAlthough E-commerce usually means selling or buying but any kind of commercial transaction through the internet can be called E-commerce.\\n\\n## E-commerce History\\n\\nin 1991 the Internet was opened to commercial use and from this moment the e-commerce purchases have become possible. But it was a security protocol development that allowed rapid access and a persistent users’ connection to the Internet. \\n\\nThe fast growth of e-commerce sales has begun from 2000 when many business companies in the United States and Western Europe started to sell on the internet. Until then the users hadn’t purchased goods via the Internet so vigorously. Both sellers and buyers realized and began to appreciate the advantages of electronic commerce. \\n\\nIf telling about the history, the first Internet companies should be mentioned which made electronic transactions possible for users, these are e.g. Amazon and eBay.\\n\\nThe most well-known Internet retail companies are Amazon, Dell, Staples, Office Depot and Hewlett Packard. And among the most popular products sold through the Internet are books, music, computers, office supplies, and other consumer electronics.\\n\\nFor the understanding of how quickly eCommerce is growing look at the statistic: \\n**Fast growing retail eCommerce sales from 1999 to 2007:**\\n![Fast growing retail eCommerce sales from 1999 to 2007](/blog/content/images/2018/11/1999-2007.png)\\n\\nIn this statistic, you can see how quickly Retail eCommerce Sales were growing compared with the Total Retail Sales in the United States.\\nBy the end of 2007, e-commerce sales accounted for more than 3 percent of total sales.\\n\\n**There are some additional facts on e-commerce retails you need to know**\\n1. The top 3 online stores' revenue was about 100 billion US dollars in 2017.\\n1. In 2016 online shopping became one of the most popular online activities worldwide but it depends on the region (e.g. 19% of all retail sales in China occurred through the internet)\\n1. Desktop PCs and mobile devices are the most popular devices for placing online shopping orders.\\n\\nAs buying or selling via the internet became really comfortable, *e-commerce sales are growing each year* and here’s statistics on retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021.\\n![statistics on retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021](/blog/content/images/2018/11/2014-2021.png)\\n\\nAs you can see the expected revenue will grow.\\n\\n## Benefits of e-commerce\\n![Benefits of e-commerce](/blog/content/images/2018/11/benefits.png)\\n\\nOf course, there are several reasons why retail eCommerce sales are so popular and still growing. \\n\\nSo what advantages do the vendors and customers get from online shopping?\\n\\n**Advantages for customers**\\n* The users can quickly compare the prices, differences and other goods’ particularities while staying at home and just clicking on the mouse.\\n* The big database of products and services can be searched through very fast. \\n* The customers have their shopping delivered directly to the door without leaving the house.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [E-commerce App Development: the Best Ways to Design Checkout Flow and Registration](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/mobile-ecommerce-app-design-checkout-flow-and-registration/)</b>\\n\\n**Advantages for vendors**\\n* The vendors can be found by customers easily and quickly, and in addition to it, these customers can make orders from all over the world so that even small stores and shops can come to the global market. \\n* There is no need to start an expensive advertising campaign. \\n* And web technology helps to find out customer preferences and to deliver targeted advertising.\\n\\nOf course, above-mentioned advantages are the main ones, and there are much more benefits from <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[e-Commerce business](https://2muchcoffee.com/ecommerce-saas)</b></u> which will be described more precisely in the coming articles.

Using it, you can easily create reusable native HTML elements with custom functionality that can be used in any environment - like React, Vue, native JavaScript, etc. \\n\\n*The main features of the functioning of custom Web components, generated with the help of Angular Elements:*\\n1. all of them are self-bootstrapped;\\n1. processing Angular application inside the custom web element;\\n1. are the connecting link between the DOM API and Angular Component;\\n1. can be used by developers who do not have experience with the Angular framework.\\n\\nSo, let's start creating the simple web component. Let it be a button that accepts a label as a parameter and returns the total number of clicks on a click event. The message about the total number of clicks will be output to the console.\\n\\t\\n*Create a new project with Angular CLI (https://cli.angular.io/) (install it globally if required)...*\\n\\n> **ng new angular-custom-button**\\n\\n*...and package Angular Elements*\\n\\n> **ng add @angular/elements**\\n\\nNext, create a new component - *the Custom Button*. For convenience, we will not create separate files for the template and component styles. In addition, in the case of \\\"ViewEncapsulation.Native\\\", the styles, template, and class of the component will be placed by the builder in one file.\\n\\n> **ng g component custom-button --inline-style**\\n> **--inline-template -v Native**\\n\\n*Change custom-button.component.ts code:*\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, OnInit, Output, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: 'app-custom-button',\\n  template: `\\n        <button (click)=\\\"clickHandler()\\\">{{ label }}</button>\\n    `,\\n  styles: [`\\n    button {\\n      min-width: 120px;\\n      min-height: 40px;\\n      font-size: 22px;\\n      outline: none;\\n      border: none;\\n      background-color: #3F92D2;\\n      color: #FFF;\\n      cursor: pointer;\\n      transition: all .2s ease-out;\\n    }\\n    button:hover {\\n      color: #FFCF40;\\n    }\\n  `],\\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Native\\n})\\nexport class CustomButtonComponent implements OnInit {\\n\\n  counter: number;\\n\\n  @Input() label: string;\\n  @Output() onButtonClick = new EventEmitter<number>();\\n\\n  ngOnInit() {\\n    this.counter = 0;\\n  }\\n\\n  clickHandler(): void {\\n    this.counter++;\\n    this.onButtonClick.emit(this.counter);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe component template is represented by a button with a label that is an incoming parameter. By tapping the button, the value of the counter is increased by 1 and an output event is emitting the current value of the counter. We also added some styles to display the button. \\n\\nNow the most important things. As the Custom Button component is not directly used in our application and is not a root component, we need to add it to the root *module entryComponents array*. In turn, the App component is no longer needed, and we can remove it completely, including from the *declarations array* of the root module.\\n\\n> **rm -rf src/app/app.component.ts src/app/app.component.css**\\n> **src/app/app.component.html** \\n> **src/app/app.component.spec.ts**\\n\\nTo create the custom element itself, we have to use the *createCustomElement* method from *@angular/elements* package, and also *Injector* from *@angular/core*. In order for Angular could use this module for bootstrapping, we should declare its method *ngDoBootstrap*.\\n\\n```javascript\\n@NgModule({\\n  declarations: [CustomButtonComponent],\\n  imports: [BrowserModule],\\n  entryComponents: [CustomButtonComponent]\\n})\\nexport class AppModule {\\n\\n  constructor(private _injector: Injector) {}\\n\\n  ngDoBootstrap() {\\n    const element = createCustomElement(CustomButtonComponent, {injector: this._injector});\\n    customElements.define('custom-button', element);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nInside the ngDoBootstrap method of App module, we call the imported *createCustomElement* method for to create a new custom element, passing the Angular component (namely our Custom Button component) to it, and the object with options, which has the injector property with the current injector entity. Next, using the *customElements.define* (the method of window object), we register the created component in the browser. This method takes two parameters:\\n\\n1. The selector of the custom component;\\n2.  The custom element itself.\\n\\nSince Custom Elements are still limitedly supported by browsers, we need to connect the polyfills.\\n\\n> **npm i @webcomponents/custom-elements --save**\\n\\n**src/polyfills.ts**\\n\\n> **import** \\n> **'@webcomponents/custom-elements/src/native-shim';**\\n> **import** \\n> **'@webcomponents/custom-elements/custom-elements.min';**\\n\\nThis concludes the development of the custom component and we begin to configure its building process. The logic of it is: when the project is built, 4 compiled files appear in the distribution directory: runtime.js, scripts.js, polyfills.js, main.js. For ease of distribution, all these files must be concatenated into one. To test the operation of our custom component, you need a simple web document, in which we connect a script with the component code. To do this, create a testing directory and add an index.html to it.\\n\\n> **mkdir testing**\\n> **touch testing/index.html**\\n\\n**testing/index.html**\\n\\n```javascript\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n<head>\\n    <meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\">\\n    <meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\">\\n    <title>Angular Elements - Button</title>\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n<custom-button label=\\\"Counter\\\"></custom-button>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"./custom-button.js\\\"></script>\\n<script>\\n    const button = document.querySelector('custom-button');\\n    button.addEventListener('onButtonClick', (event) => {\\n        console.log(`Custom button output - ${event.detail}`);\\n    });\\n</script>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nNext, we add a script to package.json to build the project with the concatenation of the files we need. In addition to the assembly, we need a local server to test the work of the custom component in the test document environment. Within the framework of this demonstration project, http-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is used.\\n\\n> **\\\"build:element\\\": \\\"ng build --prod \\n> --output-hashing=none && cat \\n> dist/angular-custom-button/{runtime,polyfills,scripts\\n> ,main}.js > ./testing/custom-button.js\\\",\\n> \\\"serve\\\": \\\"http-server ./testing\\\"**\\n\\nAfter the project is successfully built (*npm run build:element*), the .js file of our component appears in the testing directory. After executing the command *\\\"npm run serve\\\"* in the browser at *http://127.0.0.1:8080*, we will see our test document with the custom component. Using Chrome Dev Tools, we can see that inside our web component there is a Shadow DOM node, inside which the button and its styles are located. Shadow DOM encapsulates the styles of the custom component within itself, so they do not affect the styles of the other document elements.\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n![conclusions](/blog/content/images/2018/11/conclusions.png)\\nToday we looked at the process of developing a custom web component using a new feature from the Angular team - the Angular Element package. As an example, an Angular component with an input parameter and an output event emitting was used. As a result, we got a web component whose internal Angular environment is isolated from the external document and interacts with it through the described incoming and outgoing parameters. In fact, Angular Elements make it easy to modify applications for work outside the Angular environment.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>One of the introductory innovations, which pleased Angular 6, was the package of Angular Elements.

To do this, create a testing directory and add an index.html to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>mkdir testing</strong><br>\n<strong>touch testing/index.html</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>testing/index.html</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Angular Elements - Button&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;custom-button label=&quot;Counter&quot;&gt;&lt;/custom-button&gt;\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;./custom-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    const button = document.querySelector('custom-button');\n    button.addEventListener('onButtonClick', (event) =&gt; {\n        console.log(`Custom button output - ${event.detail}`);\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we add a script to package.json to build the project with the concatenation of the files we need. In addition to the assembly, we need a local server to test the work of the custom component in the test document environment. Within the framework of this demonstration project, http-server (<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server</a>) is used.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&quot;build:element&quot;: &quot;ng build --prod<br>\n--output-hashing=none &amp;&amp; cat<br>\ndist/angular-custom-button/{runtime,polyfills,scripts<br>\n,main}.js &gt; ./testing/custom-button.js&quot;,<br>\n&quot;serve&quot;: &quot;http-server ./testing&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the project is successfully built (<em>npm run build:element</em>), the .js file of our component appears in the testing directory.

Using Chrome Dev Tools, we can see that inside our web component there is a Shadow DOM node, inside which the button and its styles are located.

As an example, an Angular component with an input parameter and an output event emitting was used. As a result, we got a web component whose internal Angular environment is isolated from the external document and interacts with it through the described incoming and outgoing parameters. In fact, Angular Elements make it easy to modify applications for work outside the Angular environment.</p>\n</div>","amp":"5bf42c322e944750edc5e779","plaintext":"One of the introductory innovations, which pleased Angular 6, was the package of\nAngular Elements. Using it, you can easily create reusable native HTML elements\nwith custom functionality that can be used in any environment - like React, Vue,\nnative JavaScript, etc.\n\nThe main features of the functioning of custom Web components, generated with\nthe help of Angular Elements:\n\n 1. all of them are self-bootstrapped;\n 2. processing Angular application inside the custom web element;\n 3. are the connecting link between the DOM API and Angular Component;\n 4. can be used by developers who do not have experience with the Angular\n    framework.\n\nSo, let's start creating the simple web component. Let it be a button that\naccepts a label as a parameter and returns the total number of clicks on a click\nevent. The message about the total number of clicks will be output to the\nconsole.\n\nCreate a new project with Angular CLI (https://cli.angular.io/) (install it\nglobally if required)...\n\nng new angular-custom-button\n\n...and package Angular Elements\n\nng add @angular/elements\n\nNext, create a new component - the Custom Button. For convenience, we will not\ncreate separate files for the template and component styles. In addition, in the\ncase of \"ViewEncapsulation.Native\", the styles, template, and class of the\ncomponent will be placed by the builder in one file.\n\nng g component custom-button --inline-style\n--inline-template -v Native\n\nChange custom-button.component.ts code:\n\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, OnInit, Output, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-custom-button',\n  template: `\n        <button (click)=\"clickHandler()\">{{ label }}</button>\n    `,\n  styles: [`\n    button {\n      min-width: 120px;\n      min-height: 40px;\n      font-size: 22px;\n      outline: none;\n      border: none;\n      background-color: #3F92D2;\n      color: #FFF;\n      cursor: pointer;\n      transition: all .2s ease-out;\n    }\n    button:hover {\n      color: #FFCF40;\n    }\n  `],\n  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Native\n})\nexport class CustomButtonComponent implements OnInit {\n\n  counter: number;\n\n  @Input() label: string;\n  @Output() onButtonClick = new EventEmitter<number>();\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.counter = 0;\n  }\n\n  clickHandler(): void {\n    this.counter++;\n    this.onButtonClick.emit(this.counter);\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe component template is represented by a button with a label that is an\nincoming parameter. By tapping the button, the value of the counter is increased\nby 1 and an output event is emitting the current value of the counter. We also\nadded some styles to display the button.\n\nNow the most important things. As the Custom Button component is not directly\nused in our application and is not a root component, we need to add it to the\nroot module entryComponents array. In turn, the App component is no longer\nneeded, and we can remove it completely, including from the declarations array \nof the root module.\n\nrm -rf src/app/app.component.ts src/app/app.component.css\nsrc/app/app.component.html\nsrc/app/app.component.spec.ts\n\nTo create the custom element itself, we have to use the createCustomElement \nmethod from @angular/elements  package, and also Injector  from @angular/core.\nIn order for Angular could use this module for bootstrapping, we should declare\nits method ngDoBootstrap.\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [CustomButtonComponent],\n  imports: [BrowserModule],\n  entryComponents: [CustomButtonComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n\n  constructor(private _injector: Injector) {}\n\n  ngDoBootstrap() {\n    const element = createCustomElement(CustomButtonComponent, {injector: this._injector});\n    customElements.define('custom-button', element);\n  }\n}\n\n\nInside the ngDoBootstrap method of App module, we call the imported \ncreateCustomElement  method for to create a new custom element, passing the\nAngular component (namely our Custom Button component) to it, and the object\nwith options, which has the injector property with the current injector entity.\nNext, using the customElements.define  (the method of window object), we\nregister the created component in the browser. This method takes two parameters:\n\n 1. The selector of the custom component;\n 2. The custom element itself.\n\nSince Custom Elements are still limitedly supported by browsers, we need to\nconnect the polyfills.\n\nnpm i @webcomponents/custom-elements --save\n\nsrc/polyfills.ts\n\nimport\n'@webcomponents/custom-elements/src/native-shim';\nimport\n'@webcomponents/custom-elements/custom-elements.min';\n\nThis concludes the development of the custom component and we begin to configure\nits building process. The logic of it is: when the project is built, 4 compiled\nfiles appear in the distribution directory: runtime.js, scripts.js,\npolyfills.js, main.js. For ease of distribution, all these files must be\nconcatenated into one. To test the operation of our custom component, you need a\nsimple web document, in which we connect a script with the component code. To do\nthis, create a testing directory and add an index.html to it.\n\nmkdir testing\ntouch testing/index.html\n\ntesting/index.html\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Angular Elements - Button</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<custom-button label=\"Counter\"></custom-button>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./custom-button.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    const button = document.querySelector('custom-button');\n    button.addEventListener('onButtonClick', (event) => {\n        console.log(`Custom button output - ${event.detail}`);\n    });\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nNext, we add a script to package.json to build the project with the\nconcatenation of the files we need. In addition to the assembly, we need a local\nserver to test the work of the custom component in the test document\nenvironment. Within the framework of this demonstration project, http-server (\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is used.\n\n\"build:element\": \"ng build --prod\n--output-hashing=none && cat\ndist/angular-custom-button/{runtime,polyfills,scripts\n,main}.js > ./testing/custom-button.js\",\n\"serve\": \"http-server ./testing\"\n\nAfter the project is successfully built (npm run build:element), the .js file of\nour component appears in the testing directory. After executing the command \"npm\nrun serve\"  in the browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080, we will see our test\ndocument with the custom component. Using Chrome Dev Tools, we can see that\ninside our web component there is a Shadow DOM node, inside which the button and\nits styles are located. Shadow DOM encapsulates the styles of the custom\ncomponent within itself, so they do not affect the styles of the other document\nelements.\n\nConclusions\n\nToday we looked at the process of developing a custom web component using a new\nfeature from the Angular team - the Angular Element package.

Both product owners and single consumers profit from e-commerce. Here the pros of e-commerce are considered in details.\\n\\n**1. It’s easy and fast**\\n\\nCustomers and businesses can buy and sell everything online 24/7 a day. Consumers save time because they don’t have to leave their homes and to go shopping.\\n\\n**2. Detailed product characteristics** \\n\\nConsumers read product descriptions in the online shop and if they want to get detailed characteristics they are provided with much relevant information. Besides, online stores offer vast online catalogs and a possibility to compare goods. \\n\\n**3. Customers come to your store even without ads**  \\n\\nCustomers can follow a link in the search engine results and come to your website. Even if you are unknown and didn’t advertise your store you may get many visitors. \\n\\n**4. Research of users’ buying habits**\\n\\nWith help of eCommerce the sellers can easily find out what the buyers are interested in, what they prefer. One of the pros of e-commerce business is that on the internet it’s easy to follow user’s needs and to offer those things he is interested in. The targeted ads based on the user’s purchase behavior help to offer things he is interested in.\\n\\n**5. Easier and cheaper to start the online retails**\\n\\nLower costs are one of the most attractive e-commerce benefits. Imagine how much it costs to start running a brick and mortar store or an office. You need to hire people, you have to find the premise, you will pay for light, water etc. The business owners save a lot of money purchasing their goods or offering services on the internet. Most of the costs they need are for a well-designed user-friendly website.\\n\\n**Where exactly are you decreasing costs?**\\n![Where exactly are you decreasing costs](/blog/content/images/2018/11/where-exactly-you.png)\\n- *For ads.* \\nEspecially when you begin your business you don’t have to spend money on usual ads types. But take into account that your expenses will maybe include organic search engine traffic, social media traffic, and pay-per-click.\\n\\n- *For the store.*\\nAs it was mentioned above there are no costs for running a physical premise such as rental cost, light, water, insurance etc. There is no need to pay for store sign, store design, sales equipment or buying inventory.\\n\\n- *For personnel.*\\nActions made by the staff in the physical offices are completed automatically online. Without personnel, there are no expenses for salaries, sick leaves and holidays with pay etc. Physical stores often hire security staff, as well. Of course, some employees may be needed for customer support but it’s possible to hire them virtually from countries where the cost of living is much lower.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [E-commerce App Development](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/mobile-ecommerce-app-design-checkout-flow-and-registration/)</b>\\n\\n**6. User reviews serve as ads** \\n\\nWhen people like goods or services they can leave positive comments, reviews, and ratings, and these are serving as ads and promoting your business. Sellers profit from such testimonials, as well, because they realize which products offer high quality which ones don’t arouse interest and which ones should be removed from the list.\\n\\n**7. Sell goods or offer services worldwide with little effort** \\n\\nHow do you think how much it will cost to open brick and mortar stores in every country of the world? How much money, time and efforts will the product owner spend? And now compare all the costs with online service expense. People from some continents can order services/goods from your store and get whatever they want and whenever they want it. All you need is to promote your website and to be found in search engines.\\n\\n**8. Your store works 24/7/365**\\n\\nNo physical business in the world can work all the time and online businesses do it! It doesn’t matter if you offer a service or goods they are available all the time. It is beneficial for customers that they can start shopping at midnight, on the weekend etc. Remember that not all the customers are in the same time zone that’s why round-the-clock availability is an additional pro.\\n\\n**9. Scale the business with ease**\\n\\nIf the market demand is growing what can scale faster: an online store or a physical one? The online organization is meeting market demands more quickly and can easily reach different market segments. If you dropship you don’t need to accommodate new products, you just add them to your goods’ list.\\n\\n**10. Personalization and notifications.** \\n\\nWebsite personalization helps to improve the online shopping experience. Notifications or reminders are useful when the user added some products to the shopping cart and forgot about them. \\n\\n**11. Motivating impulse buys**\\n\\nThere are people who sometimes buy impulsively. In online stores, there are fewer factors distracting them from such actions and more possibilities to influence their emotions. Create attractive photos, positive human emotions in these photos or other ways to drive impulse buys.\\n\\n## Shortcomings and how to solve them\\n![Shortcomings and how to solve them](/blog/content/images/2018/11/SHORTCOMINGS.png)\\nAs everything in the world, eCommerce has got its shortcomings. The business owners should be aware of them and know possible solutions when problems appear.\\n\\n**1. Site crash**\\n\\nIf the site can’t be reached none of consumers can sell anything. The purchases stop. \\n\\n<u>*Solution:*</u> Actually such crash can happen to every business, but there are some pieces of advice for preventing this problem: decide upon the hosting on the right platform; you should be prepared for site crash and start testing; use CDNs; keep all software up to date with their latest versions; keep recent backups. \\n\\n\\n**2. No possibility to try**\\n\\nIf in the physical store you can try something on you can’t do the same buying things online. \\n\\n<u>*Solution:*</u> One of the options is returning goods bought online. If the return policy is well thought-out the consumers are more likely to buy at your store.\\n\\n**3. High market competition**\\n\\nThis sphere has become highly competitive and finding the right niche is not so easy. And don’t expect the ads for the most competitive niches to be cheap. You need to research the market and to find out as much as possible about the competitors.\\n\\n<u>*Solution:*</u> To attract users to your website you can pay for ads (it’s a rather expensive way); use SEO optimization; write articles, blog posts and videos in social networks, and retarget users who have visited them, etc.\\n\\n**4. Quick response needed**\\n\\nWhen users write a question to the salesperson they expect an immediate response. If nobody has responded within an hour the customers are likely to shop somewhere else. \\n\\n<u>*Solution:*</u> Don’t make your consumers wait and hire customer service personnel who respond without delay. \\n\\n**5.  Time for shipping**\\n\\nAs it has already been mentioned above the goods can be delivered from all over the world. E.g. delivery time on AliExpress can take a couple of weeks and in some cases a couple of months. If one receives goods in a month or more he would rather stop shopping and leave the website.\\n\\n<u>*Solution:*</u> Offer different options. AliExpress has offered several delivery models and consumers can choose such delivery model as paid and quick shipping. So, you should always be transparent with your customers.\\n\\nThere are many solutions of mentioned shortcomings you just need to figure out all of them if you start with an Ecommerce business.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n![conclusion-1](/blog/content/images/2018/11/conclusion-1.png)\\n\\nEcommerce business is growing very fast that’s why many business owners are interested in developing it. First of all, they need to research the market and learn about all the pros and cons of e-commerce.

Many businessmen and product owners try to represent their goods and\nservices on the internet. Using the internet purchases for your business helps\nto increase revenue.\n\nThe demand for buying and selling via the internet is increasing. According to\nstatistics, in the USA more than 60% of customers are purchasing goods online.\nThere are several reasons why people are moving from brick and mortar stores to\nonline shops and marketplaces. If you have a startup idea and are considering an\ne-Commerce business you need to know why it’s so popular at this time.\n\nAlso read our article: eCommerce: Definition, History, Statistics & Growth\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/ecommerce-definition-history-statistics/]\n\nBenefits of e-commerce\n\n\nThere are many reasons why the internet eCommerce business is developing so\nfast. Both product owners and single consumers profit from e-commerce. Here the\npros of e-commerce are considered in details.\n\n1. It’s easy and fast\n\nCustomers and businesses can buy and sell everything online 24/7 a day.\nConsumers save time because they don’t have to leave their homes and to go\nshopping.\n\n2. Detailed product characteristics\n\nConsumers read product descriptions in the online shop and if they want to get\ndetailed characteristics they are provided with much relevant information.\nBesides, online stores offer vast online catalogs and a possibility to compare\ngoods.\n\n3. Customers come to your store even without ads\n\nCustomers can follow a link in the search engine results and come to your\nwebsite. Even if you are unknown and didn’t advertise your store you may get\nmany visitors.\n\n4. Research of users’ buying habits\n\nWith help of eCommerce the sellers can easily find out what the buyers are\ninterested in, what they prefer. One of the pros of e-commerce business is that\non the internet it’s easy to follow user’s needs and to offer those things he is\ninterested in. The targeted ads based on the user’s purchase behavior help to\noffer things he is interested in.\n\n5. Easier and cheaper to start the online retails\n\nLower costs are one of the most attractive e-commerce benefits. Imagine how much\nit costs to start running a brick and mortar store or an office. You need to\nhire people, you have to find the premise, you will pay for light, water etc.\nThe business owners save a lot of money purchasing their goods or offering\nservices on the internet. Most of the costs they need are for a well-designed\nuser-friendly website.\n\nWhere exactly are you decreasing costs?\n\n\n * For ads.\n   Especially when you begin your business you don’t have to spend money on\n   usual ads types. But take into account that your expenses will maybe include\n   organic search engine traffic, social media traffic, and pay-per-click.\n   \n   \n * For the store.\n   As it was mentioned above there are no costs for running a physical premise\n   such as rental cost, light, water, insurance etc. There is no need to pay for\n   store sign, store design, sales equipment or buying inventory.\n   \n   \n * For personnel.\n   Actions made by the staff in the physical offices are completed automatically\n   online. Without personnel, there are no expenses for salaries, sick leaves\n   and holidays with pay etc. Physical stores often hire security staff, as\n   well. Of course, some employees may be needed for customer support but it’s\n   possible to hire them virtually from countries where the cost of living is\n   much lower.\n   \n   \n\nAlso read our article: E-commerce App Development\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/mobile-ecommerce-app-design-checkout-flow-and-registration/]\n\n6. User reviews serve as ads\n\nWhen people like goods or services they can leave positive comments, reviews,\nand ratings, and these are serving as ads and promoting your business. Sellers\nprofit from such testimonials, as well, because they realize which products\noffer high quality which ones don’t arouse interest and which ones should be\nremoved from the list.\n\n7. Sell goods or offer services worldwide with little effort\n\nHow do you think how much it will cost to open brick and mortar stores in every\ncountry of the world? How much money, time and efforts will the product owner\nspend? And now compare all the costs with online service expense. People from\nsome continents can order services/goods from your store and get whatever they\nwant and whenever they want it. All you need is to promote your website and to\nbe found in search engines.\n\n8. Your store works 24/7/365\n\nNo physical business in the world can work all the time and online businesses do\nit! It doesn’t matter if you offer a service or goods they are available all the\ntime. It is beneficial for customers that they can start shopping at midnight,\non the weekend etc. Remember that not all the customers are in the same time\nzone that’s why round-the-clock availability is an additional pro.\n\n9. Scale the business with ease\n\nIf the market demand is growing what can scale faster: an online store or a\nphysical one? The online organization is meeting market demands more quickly and\ncan easily reach different market segments. If you dropship you don’t need to\naccommodate new products, you just add them to your goods’ list.\n\n10. Personalization and notifications.\n\nWebsite personalization helps to improve the online shopping experience.\nNotifications or reminders are useful when the user added some products to the\nshopping cart and forgot about them.\n\n11. Motivating impulse buys\n\nThere are people who sometimes buy impulsively. In online stores, there are\nfewer factors distracting them from such actions and more possibilities to\ninfluence their emotions. Create attractive photos, positive human emotions in\nthese photos or other ways to drive impulse buys.\n\nShortcomings and how to solve them\n\nAs everything in the world, eCommerce has got its shortcomings. The business\nowners should be aware of them and know possible solutions when problems appear.\n\n1. Site crash\n\nIf the site can’t be reached none of consumers can sell anything. The purchases\nstop.\n\nSolution:  Actually such crash can happen to every business, but there are some\npieces of advice for preventing this problem: decide upon the hosting on the\nright platform; you should be prepared for site crash and start testing; use\nCDNs; keep all software up to date with their latest versions; keep recent\nbackups.\n\n2. No possibility to try\n\nIf in the physical store you can try something on you can’t do the same buying\nthings online.\n\nSolution:  One of the options is returning goods bought online. If the return\npolicy is well thought-out the consumers are more likely to buy at your store.\n\n3. High market competition\n\nThis sphere has become highly competitive and finding the right niche is not so\neasy. And don’t expect the ads for the most competitive niches to be cheap. You\nneed to research the market and to find out as much as possible about the\ncompetitors.\n\nSolution:  To attract users to your website you can pay for ads (it’s a rather\nexpensive way); use SEO optimization; write articles, blog posts and videos in\nsocial networks, and retarget users who have visited them, etc.\n\n4. Quick response needed\n\nWhen users write a question to the salesperson they expect an immediate\nresponse. If nobody has responded within an hour the customers are likely to\nshop somewhere else.\n\nSolution:  Don’t make your consumers wait and hire customer service personnel\nwho respond without delay.\n\n5. Time for shipping\n\nAs it has already been mentioned above the goods can be delivered from all over\nthe world. E.g. delivery time on AliExpress can take a couple of weeks and in\nsome cases a couple of months. If one receives goods in a month or more he would\nrather stop shopping and leave the website.\n\nSolution:  Offer different options. AliExpress has offered several delivery\nmodels and consumers can choose such delivery model as paid and quick shipping.\nSo, you should always be transparent with your customers.\n\nThere are many solutions of mentioned shortcomings you just need to figure out\nall of them if you start with an Ecommerce business.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nEcommerce business is growing very fast that’s why many business owners are\ninterested in developing it. First of all, they need to research the market and\nlearn about all the pros and cons of e-commerce. According to statistics, retail\neCommerce sales are growing very fast because of an increased demand for online\nservices and goods.\nDo you think of breaking into eCommerce or expanding your existing business with\nit?

And thus the demand on e-retail sales is growing in accordance with the buyers what is the rationale behind developing an online business.\\n\\nLet's move on to the steps for starting your online business.\\n\\n## Guide for starting an online business\\n![Guide-for-starting-an-online-business](/blog/content/images/2018/11/Guide-for-starting-an-online-business.png)\\n\\nAs many businessmen realize developing business from scratch doesn’t begin with buying and selling and it shouldn’t be launched in a hurry. Look at the following steps you have to take in that order:\\n\\n**1. Define your Ecommerce niche**\\n* At the first stage, it is advisable to choose your niche with definite products or goods/services. If you sell everything for everybody it just defocuses you unless you have a massive budget, a lot of time and personnel.\\n* The beginning business owners in their actions can take an example from successful companies already working in this area. But remember to invent new features which make your store different! \\n* If you don’t find competitors in the chosen area it may indicate an absence of demand in the market. In this case, you should research if somebody needs services or goods you are going to offer.\\n* Be careful about starting your business in the very competitive niches: you’ll have to spend a lot of time and money before you manage to keep up with them. It would be better to choose a middle competitive niche and to focus on it. \\n* Remember to examine the activities of the top competitors in your niche, read about their pros and cons. Correct your own mistakes by others’ faults. \\n* Don’t expect to come on top from the very beginning but take every opportunity to grow your customer base and to promote your goods and services. E.g. when you are selling sports clothes you can work together with niches, related to what you do, such as websites with fitness programs, sports clubs etc.\\n\\n**2. Appropriate research**\\n\\nThere are many business models depending on what you do, develop or sell. Different businesses have specific characteristics and firstly, you should endeavour to find out about them. For example, if you offer any kind of services you’ll do it differently than running product sales.\\n* *Dropshipping* is a good choice if you want to sell products without placing them in your warehouse. The ordered product is shipped from a third party directly to the customer. Another advantage of this model is little investment at the start.\\n* *Wholesaling* is another sale model which has its advantages but requires some place to store goods.\\n* *White label* branding (sometimes called *“white labeling”*) is a good choice when you’ve got an interesting product idea which can be sold under your brand.\\n* *Subscriptions* let users get access to a product or service for a definite period of time. Having ordered this service once customers get used to it, of course if you offer high-quality goods or services. \\n* Besides, you can make money from *affiliate marketing* - this model allows you to earn a commission from the promotion of other company’s products.\\n\\n**3. Identify your image and target audience**\\n\\nYou should meet expectations of your consumers or clients with everything you have: brand, website, goods, and image. That’s why knowing who your ideal customers are is crucial.\\nBefore you invest in the product, you should use ways to validate the demand. \\n\\nOne of these ways is to create an MVP (minimum viable product). Its task is to collect feedback from initial users for making a further strategy. \\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [THow to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product): your Step-by-Step Guide](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-build-a-mvp/)</b>\\n\\nYou can also begin with affiliate marketing, e.g. after defining your niche, you create content to send traffic to affiliate products. With its help, you’ll understand whether to create your brand of such goods.\\n\\n*In short, you need to:*\\n* Learn as much as possible about your target audience!\\n* Consider expectations of the consumers;\\n* After that decide upon your brand name; \\n* Test yourself products or services you are going to sell or ask some people to evaluate them (it’s important to realize their pros and cons).\\n\\n**4. Establish your business**\\n\\nNow it’s time to regularize this business. Look at the steps for establishing your business which should follow in such an order:\\n\\n1. Firstly, you should register your company and your business name. You may get legal protections when doing it.\\n1. Choose your brand name if it’s not the same as your business name. Research the niche, consider some options and choose the most appropriate one. Take into consideration that it’s an advantage when the brand name and the business name are consistent.\\n1. Get your EIN (Employer Identification Number) to open a business bank account. This number will identify your business. \\n1. Get permits and business licenses which are needed in your country and your city.\\n1. Search for right vendors if you offer products or goods. It’s important to decide upon such vendor you are ready to work for a long-term cooperation. Choosing a proper eCommerce software belongs here.\\n1. Make your logo. Read about creating the right logo and inform yourself what it should include. \\n1. Decide upon colors representing your brand, upon fonts etc.\\n\\n**5. Time to build the eCommerce store or e-commerce website**\\nIf all the business licenses are ready it’s time to register the domain name. Remember that the design for your business should be compatible with your e-commerce software. \\n\\nSo what should you take into account when choosing e-commerce platforms? Consider such parameters like the loading speed, features, compatibility with different payment gateways and with your business structure, your web developer skills, SEO-friendly features etc.\\n\\nDepending on your budget you can either hire professionals to help you or do everything on your own. Each choice has its pros and cons.\\n\\nIf you want to build the website from scratch you have to make sure that your developers have already worked with building e-commerce websites. <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[Feel free to ask](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u> how long it takes to launch your site.\\nIf you want to take the easy way out, choose such a marketplace like Amazon where you won’t have difficulties with taking credit card payments.\\n\\n**6. Search for clients or customers**\\n\\nAs in the previous step, you can either choose to hire help or do everything on your own.\\n\\nYour website has to be SEO-friendly to stay competitive enough in the market.\\nThe keywords should be present in URLs, in ads of your website, on each page. But remember if you try to manipulate a page ranking with keyword stuffing, \\nGoogle and other search engines will penalize your site.\\n\\nThink about how to drive traffic to your website.\\nA lot of elbow grease is required if you can’t invest a lot in online marketing. Top companies invest heavily in their ad campaigns, especially at the beginning.\\n\\n*So how to drive traffic to your site?*\\n* Read and listen to marketing tips; \\n* use social networks to attract clients and customers;   \\n* Use pay-per-click ads, if you have enough budget;\\n* Place videos about your company and create reviews of products or services on Youtube etc.\\n\\nIf it is too difficult for you the best option is just to find and to hire help.\\n\\n**7. Market your goods or services**\\n\\nHaving built an Ecommerce business is not the end, it’s a beginning and further, you need to promote your company for attracting users and maintaining your current market share. Bear in mind that just starting your Ecommerce business is not as tough as going the level of top competitors.\\n\\nLook at these *ideas of generating some users’ heat:*\\n* Create an email list or get phone numbers from users. You can do it when launching a social media campaign or offering some coupons and discounts where the users need to enter an email or a phone number.\\n* Then you can send content, interesting offers and many other things to your visitors to keep them interested. \\n* Ask them for reviews and respond fast if there are some questions or problems.\\n* Track the behaviour of the users on your website. You need to know how and where the traffic flows. It happens from time to time that firstly the website aroused interest but then the users left it in the same place.\\n* Find tools which serve as help in monitoring and optimizing the marketing process.\\n* Sometimes you should follow the lead of your competitors and take some additional tricks from them.\\n* There are many other ways to promote goods and services, e.g. you offer your products for popular bloggers and they create reviews. It’s important to remember that these bloggers should be in the same niche as you are, for example, you send Makeup and Beauty products to a fashion blogger or children books to the young mom. \\n* Sometimes users are offered additional coupons or discounts for placing reviews, inviting new users etc.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n![conclusion-3](/blog/content/images/2018/11/conclusion-3.png)\\n\\neCommerce business has become a very competitive sphere and business owners have to take many factors into account if they want to succeed. \\n\\nIf you think of building your online business you can do it on your own or with help of skilled developers. If you decide to take the first way we hope that this guide is helpful for you! \\n\\nIf you choose the second option make sure you find professionals who have had experience with e-commerce development. <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[Feel free to contact](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u> us and remember your ready business is not the finish but the start of an adventure. \"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Nowadays many product owners are interested in building their eCommerce businesses from scratch because of many reasons.

In this article we are going to\nconsider these reasons and the steps for creating an online business in order to\nhelp you with developing it.\n\nIn 2017 global e-retail sales reached 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars. Online shopping\nhas become one of the most popular online activities in the world, and among the\ncountries which belong to the fastest growing online retail markets, there are\nIndia, Indonesia, Mexico, and China.\n\nThe online business is really profitable but highly competitive. Actually, the\nnumber of online buyers is growing, too so don’t get upset.\n\nRetail e-commerce sales as a percent of global retail sales from 2015 to 2021\n\n\nAs you can see from the statistic, in 2015 e-retail sales accounted for 7,4% of\nall retail sales worldwide. This figure is expected to reach 17.5 percent in\n2021.\n\nNumber of digital buyers worldwide from 2014 to 2021 (in billions)\n\n\nAccording to the forecast, the number of digital buyers will be increasing and\nis expected to reach 2,14 billions in 2021. And thus the demand on e-retail\nsales is growing in accordance with the buyers what is the rationale behind\ndeveloping an online business.\n\nLet's move on to the steps for starting your online business.\n\nGuide for starting an online business\n\n\nAs many businessmen realize developing business from scratch doesn’t begin with\nbuying and selling and it shouldn’t be launched in a hurry. Look at the\nfollowing steps you have to take in that order:\n\n1. Define your Ecommerce niche\n\n * At the first stage, it is advisable to choose your niche with definite\n   products or goods/services. If you sell everything for everybody it just\n   defocuses you unless you have a massive budget, a lot of time and personnel.\n * The beginning business owners in their actions can take an example from\n   successful companies already working in this area. But remember to invent new\n   features which make your store different!\n * If you don’t find competitors in the chosen area it may indicate an absence\n   of demand in the market. In this case, you should research if somebody needs\n   services or goods you are going to offer.\n * Be careful about starting your business in the very competitive niches:\n   you’ll have to spend a lot of time and money before you manage to keep up\n   with them. It would be better to choose a middle competitive niche and to\n   focus on it.\n * Remember to examine the activities of the top competitors in your niche, read\n   about their pros and cons. Correct your own mistakes by others’ faults.\n * Don’t expect to come on top from the very beginning but take every\n   opportunity to grow your customer base and to promote your goods and\n   services. E.g. when you are selling sports clothes you can work together with\n   niches, related to what you do, such as websites with fitness programs,\n   sports clubs etc.\n\n2. Appropriate research\n\nThere are many business models depending on what you do, develop or sell.\nDifferent businesses have specific characteristics and firstly, you should\nendeavour to find out about them. For example, if you offer any kind of services\nyou’ll do it differently than running product sales.\n\n * Dropshipping  is a good choice if you want to sell products without placing\n   them in your warehouse. The ordered product is shipped from a third party\n   directly to the customer. Another advantage of this model is little\n   investment at the start.\n * Wholesaling  is another sale model which has its advantages but requires some\n   place to store goods.\n * White label  branding (sometimes called “white labeling”) is a good choice\n   when you’ve got an interesting product idea which can be sold under your\n   brand.\n * Subscriptions  let users get access to a product or service for a definite\n   period of time. Having ordered this service once customers get used to it, of\n   course if you offer high-quality goods or services.\n * Besides, you can make money from affiliate marketing  - this model allows you\n   to earn a commission from the promotion of other company’s products.\n\n3. Identify your image and target audience\n\nYou should meet expectations of your consumers or clients with everything you\nhave: brand, website, goods, and image. That’s why knowing who your ideal\ncustomers are is crucial.\nBefore you invest in the product, you should use ways to validate the demand.\n\nOne of these ways is to create an MVP (minimum viable product). Its task is to\ncollect feedback from initial users for making a further strategy.\n\nAlso read our article: THow to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product): your\nStep-by-Step Guide [https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-build-a-mvp/]\n\nYou can also begin with affiliate marketing, e.g. after defining your niche, you\ncreate content to send traffic to affiliate products. With its help, you’ll\nunderstand whether to create your brand of such goods.\n\nIn short, you need to:\n\n * Learn as much as possible about your target audience!\n * Consider expectations of the consumers;\n * After that decide upon your brand name;\n * Test yourself products or services you are going to sell or ask some people\n   to evaluate them (it’s important to realize their pros and cons).\n\n4. Establish your business\n\nNow it’s time to regularize this business. Look at the steps for establishing\nyour business which should follow in such an order:\n\n 1. Firstly, you should register your company and your business name. You may\n    get legal protections when doing it.\n 2. Choose your brand name if it’s not the same as your business name. Research\n    the niche, consider some options and choose the most appropriate one. Take\n    into consideration that it’s an advantage when the brand name and the\n    business name are consistent.\n 3. Get your EIN (Employer Identification Number) to open a business bank\n    account. This number will identify your business.\n 4. Get permits and business licenses which are needed in your country and your\n    city.\n 5. Search for right vendors if you offer products or goods. It’s important to\n    decide upon such vendor you are ready to work for a long-term cooperation.\n    Choosing a proper eCommerce software belongs here.\n 6. Make your logo. Read about creating the right logo and inform yourself what\n    it should include.\n 7. Decide upon colors representing your brand, upon fonts etc.\n\n5. Time to build the eCommerce store or e-commerce website\nIf all the business licenses are ready it’s time to register the domain name.\nRemember that the design for your business should be compatible with your\ne-commerce software.\n\nSo what should you take into account when choosing e-commerce platforms?\nConsider such parameters like the loading speed, features, compatibility with\ndifferent payment gateways and with your business structure, your web developer\nskills, SEO-friendly features etc.\n\nDepending on your budget you can either hire professionals to help you or do\neverything on your own. Each choice has its pros and cons.\n\nIf you want to build the website from scratch you have to make sure that your\ndevelopers have already worked with building e-commerce websites. Feel free to\nask [https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts]  how long it takes to launch your site.\nIf you want to take the easy way out, choose such a marketplace like Amazon\nwhere you won’t have difficulties with taking credit card payments.\n\n6.

If you\nbelong to them here’s a guide on how to make a music application.\nWhen speaking about a music app we should remember that there are some types of\nit. They are designed for different purposes.\n\nMusic Streaming apps  - they deliver music to the users without the songs to be\ndownloaded from the internet on your device. Here belong such well-known apps\nlike Spotify and Pandora.\n\nMusic Player apps  - in contrast to the previous type these apps should be\ndownloaded on your device. The users can make their private music collections,\nplay audio files etc. For example, these are iTunes, Windows Media Player and\nRealPlayer.\n\nMusic Identification apps  - they identify songs and singers the users want to\nfigure out. The most famous music Identification apps are Shazam, SoundHound and\nTrackID.\n\nMusic Download apps  - with their help the users can download music. These are\nFreegal Music, Beats Music etc.\n\nMusic Making apps  - these are software for music production. With their help\nyou can mix your vocals and create new melodies. There are many popular apps\nlike Garageband, Songify, Animoog.\n\nTypes of music streaming applications\n\n\nFor the beginning you need to know the types of streaming apps and to decide\nwhich type your streaming app will belong to:\n\nCloud Storage.  With this model the users can store music, songs and stream\nanywhere and anytime.\n\nTheme Radio Station.  It helps to choose a definite radio theme or themes and\nlisten to only chosen options.\n\nMusic Library.  The user can create his own music library. Then he offers access\nto it to other customers, sometimes this access is paid or partially paid.\n\nFirstly, you have to decide what type of a streaming app you plan to develop.\nSecondly, decide upon the features you need to see in your app. Remember to\nplace “must-have” features to your music application and add some new ones.\n\nThe most important features of music streaming apps\n\n\nAccording to statistic, the variety of music was named the most important\nfeature of music streaming services.\n\nLook through other preferable features:\n\n\nThere are “must-have” features which are usually present in every music app.\nBesides, every app should have unique features and come to the market with them.\n\n“Must-have” features:\n\nIf you are planning to launch your music app don’t miss these important points,\nall music apps have them and you should take them into account.\n\nSignup and Signin\nThere are some options. One of them is to use your music app without signing up.\nAnother option is to make a quick and comfortable signup/signin via Facebook,\nInstagram or other social networks. Instead of social networks, there can be\nregistration via email or phone number. Why is it a better option? Because this\nway helps to monetize an app. Then the user can create his own account and make\nhis playlist, get access to paid features.\n\nSearch for music\nUsers surely want to find new songs and new favourite tracks.\nThink of proposing them new songs based on the categories and singers they like.\nThere is an option to make other categories like Top songs, Most popular, The\nnewest tracks etc.\n\nOption to make playlists\nYou should give your users the option to store songs, albums, to add them to\ntheir libraries. Actually, almost all music apps provide this option.\n\nSocial sharing\nThis feature helps to make your app well-known. Users like to share music they\nare listening to in social media so that other people can see it. This is a good\nopportunity to become famous rather quickly.\n\nOnline and offline mode\nThe first one is important for sharing tracks or for downloading music. The\noffline access is important when the internet is slow, when users save bandwidth\nor when there is no internet connection. In this case, the users can store music\nand listen to it from their library.\n\nAdditional feature ideas\n\nThere are other features which are not so important but they can make your app\nunique among the similar apps. We gathered several ideas here and you can pick\none of them, some of them, or add the new ones. Usually, when developing an app\none core feature and some additional features make it special.\n\nSong info\nIt is a great idea to let users discover more details about every song, for\nexample release year, general info about the singers or the band, details about\nthe song and video creating, details about the whole album etc.\n\nLyrics\nOffer the users the lyrics of the song and display them while the users are\nlistening to the song. Additionally, they can get the translation into their\nnative language, and the text playing right now should be highlighted in both\nlanguages. (People learning the foreign language will be grateful to you).\nIt would be a good option to remove lyrics displaying and to listen only to the\nmusic without the lyrics.\n\nOption to record own songs, to upload these songs and the chosen music to\nseparate libraries.\nSome songs the users like may be absent in your playlists and the users should\nhave a possibility to add their favourite tracks.\n\nCategorisation of songs into different record genres (romantic songs, peaceful\nsongs, relaxing sleep music etc.)\n\nOption to set the chosen song as a ringtone\nIt’s a very desired option because each user has ever set his favourite song as\na new ringtone\n\nOption to view the video of the song on the internet.\nThis option will entertain the users. People can watch their favourite artists\nwhile listening to the song.\n\nMusic Identification\nIt would be great to add a “Shazam” option to your streaming app. If the user\nhears the unknown song he can identify it, add to his playlist and enjoy\nlistening to it after he has learnt its origin.\n\nOf course, knowing the features is not the end. Beginning with the music\napplication development you should know some simple steps:\n\nRead our article: Mobile application development: Top 9 steps to build your\nstartup [https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/]\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMusic app development [https://2muchcoffee.com/music-app]  is a good idea.\nBefore you get started a lot of preparatory work has to be done. Our advice is\nto research the market of streaming apps and to figure out if your streaming app\nhas unique features and doesn’t become one of many similar apps.\n\nRemember that the music streaming app should contain one core feature and some\nadditional unique features. We tried to give some pieces of advice to simplify\nthe streaming music app development for you.\n\nIf you have some coding knowledge you can build the app on your own.

Shopify\\n![shopify](/blog/content/images/2018/12/shopify.png)\\n\\nIt belongs to top e-commerce and the most well-known websites. But its prices are very affordable.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\nThe first benefit is that it offers a 14-day free trial. The signup is very quick, you only need to enter your email and can sell right away. The interface of your online store is very simple and you are offered many beautiful themes. \\nThe other advantage is that no coding knowledge is required.\\nYou can get support via phone, email, live chat, and Twitter.\\nAdditionally, this platform offers third-party payment gateways. \\n\\n**Cons:**\\nCosts accumulate and it can come to the rather high sum because you will have many additional costs e.g. pay for plugins, themes, features or transaction fees.\\nBesides, Shopify uses its own markup language “Liquid” based on Ruby on Rails. If you want to make changes by your own it can be difficult.\\n\\nThis platform is highly customizable and helps the beginners to start with their stores quickly thanks to the easy learning curve. It offers very reasonable prices.\\n\\n### 2. BigCommerce\\n![bigcommerce](/blog/content/images/2018/12/bigcommerce.png)\\n\\nThis platform is rather similar to Shopify. It can serve as a full SAAS platform or you can use it as a shopping cart system for other websites. \\n\\n**Pros:**\\nThe main pro of BigCommerce that it is a feature-rich solution with flexible shipping options (unlimited product variants, options to handle returns). This platform offers integrations to social networks or such popular selling platforms as Amazon or eBay and hosting websites, analytics tools, marketing features, open architecture interface etc. \\nAbout 40 payment processing options are offered to business owners but no transaction fee is required.\\nThe live support is available.\\n\\n**There are some cons:**\\nYou can choose from 7 free templates. Other ones are paid and rather expensive. \\nAs the platform owns no native POS features the business owners have to pay for advanced features what can be rather expensive. \\n\\nIt’s a good platform for beginning your business especially if it is expecting quick growth.\\n\\n### 3. Wix \\n![wix](/blog/content/images/2018/12/wix.png)\\n\\nWix is very easy to use. It is not expensive, very user-friendly, offers many templates and themes and even if you choose paid themes they are affordable, as well. \\n\\n**Pros of Wix:**\\nThis platform is very easy, cheap and user-friendly. \\nYou don’t need to be skilled in coding. \\nThe stick images and over 500 templates are offered. Using this platform you get an integrated shopping cart. There are direct payments without commission.\\nBesides, Wix functions on any device and takes care of hosting itself.\\n\\n**Cons:**\\nOne of the drawbacks is an impossibility to change the chosen template if the website has already been published. \\nWix is a kind of a website builder that’s why the capabilities are a little limited and if you have got high requirements Wix may not meet your demands.\\n\\nIf you are beginning with a small business and don’t have special requirements for your future online store Wix is a good solution.\\n\\n### 4. Volusion\\n![volusion](/blog/content/images/2018/12/volusion.png)\\n\\nIt is a cloud-based solution which offers 11 free and many paid themes.\\nIf you are a beginner in sales and want to build a simple eye-catchy website you can easily begin with Volusion.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\nIt’s a customizable website builder with many themes which provides e-commerce and product management tools. There is integration with payment providers. It helps you to build a fully-functional online store.\\nConcerning SEO the platform offers a great reporting (abandoned cart summaries, ROI tracking & reports, product views, RMAs etc.) \\n\\n**Cons:**\\nThere is a bandwidth limit depending on the chosen plan. Additional traffic will cost $7/GB. \\nThe business owners need to pay for SSL additionally. Besides, premium templates are rather expensive. And there is no capability to add a blog and you can only add links to other blog sites.\\n\\n### 5. SquareSpace\\n![squarespace](/blog/content/images/2018/12/squarespace.png)\\n\\nIt’s a kind of a drag-and-drop website builder which becomes a full-fledged e-commerce platform. Its interface is very user-friendly and it will do for beginners. It fits both individuals and businesses.\\n\\n**Pros:** This website is focused on design and aesthetics what is useful for selling products which require high-quality representation. There are all usual options e.g. product variants, unlimited products, coupons, shipping. You can use many marketing tools and a built-in SSL. The site offers an easy navigation. \\n\\n**Cons:** On every sale, the business owners have to pay a 3% transaction fee.\\nBesides, if you are planning to build a big online store the number of features may be not enough for you.\\nIf you want to customize your store with coding or markup you encounter limited customizability.\\n\\nIf you are a beginner in sales, if you don’t want to create a big store or if you want to build your own website you can pick SquareSpace.\\n\\n### 6. Magento\\n![magento](/blog/content/images/2018/12/magento.png)\\n\\nThis platform is an open source software you can install on your servers. For small businesses, it is very expensive because its price starts at $2200/month. You should pay for the domain and hosting although Magento is a free e-commerce platform. \\nThis E-Commerce platform is written in PHP so either you need to have skills in it or hire somebody who helps you.\\n\\n**Pros:** Product owners if they are skilled in coding can modify functionality, design and server environment. Otherwise, you may pick the cloud edition.\\nThis platform fits if you need to integrate your store with CRM or ERP.\\nFor the offered price Magento provides a long list of features: subscriptions, recurring payments, discounts, there are many plugins and themes, ability to build a multilingual website as well as the great support.  \\n\\n**Cons:** Magento developers are more expensive because of a steep learning curve.  \\nThe price is meant for Enterprise clients and large businesses and can be very high for the small ones.\\n\\nMagento meets demands of enterprise businesses and can be too expensive for small ones.\\n\\n### 7. OpenCart\\n![opencart](/blog/content/images/2018/12/opencart.png)\\n\\n*OpenCart* is available to download and install on your server. It doesn’t offer a lot of features in its basic version. Additionally, there is a cloud version. If saying about support you can choose from documentation and forums.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\nIf you want to have a lot of products and product categories this E-Commerce platform will help you. \\nThere is a possibility to create and control a few online shops from one interface because you can view every important data point of your store.\\nMany themes and plugin extensions are offered and a lot of payment gateways is supported.\\nChoosing the cloud version you get access to the necessary theme and a plugin store. \\nThe SSL certificate is offered for free.\\n\\n**Cons:**\\nFirstly, you need to learn how to use this platform because it needs skills to work with it. Sometimes OpenCart is not so easily customizable.\\nIf we talk about native marketing features the default SEO capabilities could be better.\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter if you are launching a small or large enterprise you will succeed with this platform but you need some WordPress knowledge.\\n\\n### 8. Selz\\n![selz](/blog/content/images/2018/12/selz.png)\\n\\nIt fits those who are planning to start their small businesses, save money with an affordable platform and have 24/7 support.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\nSelz is a good idea for beginners. You are offered round-the-clock customer support, user-friendly tools, and many customization options, besides, you don’t need additional coding skills for work with Selz.\\nIf you are trying to sell with social networks or from other websites Selz is an affordable choice. \\n\\n**Cons:**\\nIt’s a good option for small businesses. But if you are planning to scale your business it’s maybe not the right platform. You can hardly customize it for a growing business.\\n\\n### 9. WooCommerce\\n![woocommerce](/blog/content/images/2018/12/woocommerce.png)\\n\\nThis Ecommerce solution is actually a WordPress plugin and plugs to this platform. To work with, you need to know Wordpress. \\nUsers should take into account that no live support is present. You get documentation and forums.\\n\\n**Pros:** It gives the full control over the website functionality. \\nBesides, WooCommerce doesn’t take any transaction fee.\\n\\n**Cons:** You need to have some knowledge of Wordpress. If some questions appear you’ll have to search through documentation or write on forums trying to find the answer.\\nThe expenses for this platform accumulate and are difficult to count at once.\\n\\n### 10. BigCartel\\n![bigcartel](/blog/content/images/2018/12/bigcartel.png)\\n\\nThis e-commerce software fits for small ventures and offers free themes.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\nIt offers a quick setup and you don’t need to have coding knowledge. There are features matching the small business: Sell in-person, Sell on Facebook, five images per product, Inventory tracking etc.\\nIf you have questions you can ask for help a Support Center.\\n\\n**Cons:**\\nThe free version is limited and medium customized. The platform is probably not the best option for large enterprises.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n![conclusion](/blog/content/images/2018/12/conclusion.png)\\n\\nIn this article, we considered the main Ecommerce platforms, their advantages, and disadvantages.\\n\\nSome of them help for small enterprises, others meet demands of large businesses, some are affordable, the others are more expensive.

Let’s consider each of them:\\n1. Through hierarchical component’s interaction, typically use of “smart” and “dumb” components via input bindings and custom events.\\n2. Through Angular services by using simple variables and Promises.\\n3. Through Observable data services.\\n4.  Through Redux pattern.\\n\\n### Hierarchical component’s interaction\\nAngular comes with a simple and clear interaction structure: a “stateful” parent component delegates data down into “stateless” children components. Its pro is testing simplicity and transparency: if there are some changes in a parent component, you can easily track down which of the child components are influenced (see Picture 1).\\n![Hierarchical component’s interaction](/blog/content/images/2018/12/p1.png)\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">Picture 1</p>\\n\\nIt’s a good solution if your app is simple. As soon as the architecture of this application becomes more complex or if you want to share data between separate modules/components through Angular services, this process becomes useless and confusing (see Picture 2).\\n![p2](/blog/content/images/2018/12/p2.png)\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">Picture 2</p>\\n\\n### Angular services, variables & Promises\\n\\nThe current approach has some advantages and disadvantages. It’s possible to use this approach but only within a very simple application. Let’s explain the reasons for such a statement.\\n\\nWhen talking about large applications we see some problems in using this approach. The first of them appears when using simple variables for temporary data saving. It’s impossible simultaneously and over time to monitor data changes in multiple separate components through Angular services properly.  Moreover, there’s a huge chance of mutation the same data instance by reference in one of the components, which leads to unpredictable issues and consequences through the entire application.\\n\\nThe second weakness is Promises. As you know Angular offers support of Observables, which facilitates handling multiple values over time, the usage of Promises with its single values looks like a backward step!\\n\\n*The cons of Promises:*\\n* It’s impossible to run Promise every time you need it because it executes instantly and only once - at the inception;\\n* You can get only a single value or an error message from Promise;\\n* You can’t cancel the request initiated from a Promise e.g. an HTTP request that does a search on the key-up event would be executed as many times as we press the key;\\n* When you are trying to regain a retry capability of a failed call - this can lead to a callback hell.\\n\\nIt follows from the above, that Promises have issues in large-scale apps, besides, we lose a vast functionality when compared with the Observable pattern. \\n\\nThe two above mentioned built-in approaches for managing state can be used if the application is not large. Let’s imagine that our app is growing and has a lot of components. That’s why we are going to consider another almost built-in Angular toolbox - RxJS.\\n\\n### Observable Data Services - Angular services with RxJS\\n\\nRxJS might be a good solution to the issues concerning Promises and data changing over time. Let’s consider what Observables data services are. These are data streams which offer higher flexibility when creating an app and managing the state of the app with help of multiple Angular services (singletons).\\n\\nThe Observable store pattern is a better solution and is more useful for simple apps than a bulky third-party library store. But this approach has its cons, as well. If you are developing an app and trying to carry out the custom state management, you’ll miss the unified and centralized system in this approach.\\n\\n*Here’s a simple app which was written on Angular 5 and RxJS 5.5.11 version. This app has got three main routes:*\\n* Customers - there is a list of customers with its details.\\n* Products - there is a list of products with its details.\\n* Invoices - there is a list on invoices and its details. Additionally, the users can add a new invoice, as well as view, edit and remove a specific invoice.\\n\\n```javascript\\n@Injectable()\\nexport class InvoicesService {\\n  \\n  passInvoicesRequest: Subject<any> = new Subject();\\n  invoicesList$: ConnectableObservable<Invoice[]>;\\n  invoicesListCombined$: Observable<Invoice[]>;\\n  invoicesCollection$: ConnectableObservable<Invoice[]>;\\n  \\n  addInvoice$: Subject<Invoice> = new Subject();\\n  addInvoiceToCollection$: Observable<any>;\\n\\n  deleteInvoice$: Subject<string> = new Subject();\\n  deleteInvoiceOpenModal$: Subject<string> = new Subject();\\n  deleteInvoiceFromCollection$: Observable<Invoice[]>;\\n  deleteInvoiceModal$: ConnectableObservable<Invoice>;\\n  \\n  constructor(\\n    private httpClient: HttpClient,\\n    private customersService: CustomersService,\\n    private productsService: ProductsService,\\n    private modalBoxService: ModalBoxService,\\n  ) {\\n    // get initial invoices collection\\n    this.invoicesList$ = this.passInvoicesRequest.pipe(\\n      mergeScan(acc => acc ? Observable.of(acc) : this.getInvoicesRequest(), null),\\n    ).publishReplay(1);\\n    this.invoicesList$.connect();\\n    \\n    // add customer info to initial invoices collection\\n    this.invoicesListCombined$ = combineLatest(\\n      this.invoicesList$,\\n      this.customersService.customersList$.pipe(take(1))\\n    ).pipe(\\n      map(([invoices, customers]) => invoices.map(invoice =>\\n        ({\\n          ...invoice,\\n          customer: customers.find(customer => invoice.customer_id === customer._id),\\n        }))\\n      ),\\n    );\\n\\n    // add a new invoice to a collection\\n    this.addInvoiceToCollection$ = this.addInvoice$.pipe(\\n      switchMap(newInvoice => this.invoicesCollection$.pipe(\\n        withLatestFrom(this.customersService.customersList$),\\n        map(([invoices, customers]) =>\\n          [\\n            ...invoices,\\n            {\\n              ...newInvoice,\\n              customer: customers.find(customer => newInvoice['customer_id'] === customer._id)\\n            },\\n          ]\\n        ),\\n        take(1),\\n      ))\\n    );\\n\\n    // delete an invoice from collection\\n    this.deleteInvoiceFromCollection$ = this.deleteInvoice$.pipe(\\n      switchMap(id => this.invoicesCollection$.pipe(\\n        map(invoices => invoices.filter(invoice => invoice._id !== id)),\\n        take(1),\\n      ))\\n    );\\n\\n    // open delete-invoice modal window and send delete request to DB by confirm from user\\n    this.deleteInvoiceModal$ = this.deleteInvoiceOpenModal$.pipe(\\n      mergeMap(id => this.modalBoxService.confirmModal('Are you sure you want to delete an invoice?').pipe(\\n        filter(choice => !!choice),\\n        mapTo(id),\\n      )),\\n      switchMap(id => this.deleteInvoiceRequest(id)),\\n      tap(invoices => this.modalBoxService.confirmModal(`Invoice number ${invoices._id} has been deleted`, false)),\\n    ).publishReplay(1);\\n    this.deleteInvoiceModal$.connect();\\n\\n    // main invoices collection to display\\n    this.invoicesCollection$ = Observable.merge(\\n      this.invoicesListCombined$.pipe(take(1)),\\n      this.addInvoiceToCollection$,\\n      this.deleteInvoiceFromCollection$,\\n    ).publishReplay(1);\\n    this.invoicesCollection$.connect();\\n  }\\n\\n  getInvoicesRequest() {\\n    return this.httpClient.get<Invoice[]>('invoices');\\n  }\\n\\n  getInvoices() {\\n    this.passInvoicesRequest.next();\\n    return this.invoicesList$;\\n  }\\n\\n  deleteInvoiceRequest(id) {\\n    return this.httpClient.delete<Invoice>(`invoices/${id}`).pipe(\\n      tap(deletedInvoice => this.deleteInvoice$.next(deletedInvoice._id))\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe should mention that this approach relies on pure RxJS streams. \\n\\nThe first step is to fetch data from API in invoicesList$ stream, then to pass its value (a collection of invoices) to invoicesListCombined$ stream (it contains customersList$ stream (a collection of customers) declared in customers service). This stream is just transforming every invoice by appending customer info to it.\\n\\nThen we’re going to carry out functionality within invoices in accordance with the specs and to be able to expand it in the future.\\n\\nSo, the second step is to create the invoicesCollection$ base stream that has an async subscription in a template for displaying a whole invoice list to the user. \\n\\nAs you can see, this stream was expanded with 2 other streams: addInvoiceToCollection$ and deleteInvoiceFromCollection$, which accordingly transform the data of the main invoicesCollection$ stream.\\n\\nThis approach is not so simple as you can imagine and we’ll tell you why.\\n\\n**-** To use it, you should understand the RxJS operators very well;\\n**-** You have to define which streams are supposed to be “hot”, “cold” or “warm” and whether they are re-used in other services/components or not;\\n**-** It’s easy to get confused and after that, you’ll have to work a lot on debugging.\\n**-** The main drawback of this approach is that it’s scalable just within this current service and couldn’t be reusable. The reason is that you will have to repeat and modify the ready code in the other service if you work with other data.\\n\\nAlthough the above-mentioned approach is working really fast, we have tried to find out a more efficient solution that could be scalable and reusable for the whole app. We spent some time and found such a solution that unfortunately wasn’t worth that. That solution should follow the DRY principle and make the State implementation reusable entirely through the Angular application that’s why at first, we have created a generic type Class (e.g. class StateManagement<T.>).\\n\\nSecondly, we have added a simple collection$ stream to this Class - it would represent the future data collections. Each time when StateManagement Class is called through the “new” operator  - a new instance of this Class would be created with new data inside of collection$ stream. \\n\\n```javascript\\nexport class InvoiceService {\\n\\tstate: StateManagement<Invoice>;\\nconstructor() {\\nthis.state = new StateManagement<Invoice>();\\n// this.state.collection$ would contain collection of invoices\\n}\\n}\\n...\\n```\\n\\nThen, we added to the Class basic CRUD functions of persistent storage because we wanted to be able to transform data in the future. So, when comparing with the previous example all code that was responsible for managing the application State was declared only in one place. That could be called a significant enhancement but two main problems which appeared within this approach should be mentioned here, as well:\\n\\n1. **Combining different separate States** - unfortunately, it’s very easy to get confused with many “CombineLatest” across the whole application. Because of this problem, the code becomes more complex and less readable.\\n2. **Sequential requests and catching/processing errors**\\nAs an example, we wanted to get the State of Users and then to get a State for specific Invoices based on a current User Id. As the “StateManagement” Class is unified it becomes a problem to find a proper place for this specific request to be done and to catch/process its errors. Let’s imagine that our app is growing and getting new features. Where should we add more separate sequential requests? There can be no question of consistency of our code at all.\\n\\nHowever, the Observable Data Services are a good approach and a powerful solution which helps to use built-in features of Angular. You just need to take some points into account:\\n1. You should be very good at using RxJS library and Observable Pattern. You should know and distinguish the “cold”, “warm” and “hot” Observable. You have to know how to transform one into another, when to use and which one to use.\\n1. The process of catching/handling errors and testing the app is not so easy - it’s pretty complicated to clarify whether it’s behaving according to specs.\\n1. Remember that every solution is very custom, that’s why other developers should need time for understanding and maintaining it, especially if we talk about large apps.\\n\\nAs it follows from the above there are some issues within this approach. Trying not to do unnecessary work we were searching for another state management solution and the eye-catching one was REDUX. \\n\\n### Redux Pattern with RxJS\\n![redux-rxjs](/blog/content/images/2018/12/redux-rxjs.png)\\n\\nAs described in the docs, Redux is \\\"a predictable state container for JavaScript apps”. It offers an easy and very simple solution when data moves in one direction only, it means that data flow is very predictable and explicit.\\n\\n*Here are necessary definitions:*\\n* Component  - view template user can interact with;\\n* Action - defines (dispatches) the change in State that is to be made;\\n* Reducer - a pure function, meaning, it doesn’t produce side effects , which has access to the current State;\\n* Selector - defines which specific data get from the Store;\\n* Effect - handles everything that is asynchronous or outside the application.\\n![1](/blog/content/images/2018/12/1.png)\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">Picture 3</p>\\n\\nMaybe, it seems difficult and time-taking because you should set up the necessary structure of the app and write much boilerplate code. But let’s find out how it works using this small example that helps to clarify everything and demonstrates the benefits of this approach. \\n\\nWhen the user clicks the button in a component’s view template, the corresponding Action is dispatched to the Store. When the action is initiated the Reducer gets the current State and the data from the Action and then it brings back the new State from it. **Reducers don’t store or mutate State - they just take the previous State and the Action and give back the new State.**\\n\\n*Let’s consider the advantages of Redux:*\\n\\n **-** When you maintain all States in a Store and use the async pipe to wire up to the view you are able to control the change detection that greatly improves the performance in enterprise apps.\\n \\nAdditionally, Redux provides us with Selectors called with the Store’s select method (Picture 4)\\n![2](/blog/content/images/2018/12/2.png)\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">Picture 4</p>\\n\\nThis Store’s select method helps to get the current State with a help of Selector that returns a stream. The last one brings back values whenever State changes. This helps the component to be informed and receive the last data version from the Store.\\n\\nAs you can see from the above-mentioned scheme, the data flow isn’t complicated at all and it’s very transparent. The reason is that the data always comes from one source.\\n\\n **-** Let’s talk about one more advantage. We have already mentioned above that there is such an issue in the Observable Data Services approach as different separate states’ combining. But the selectors easily solve this issue. They can pass and сluster together various slices of the State for creating data which the definite component needs.\\n\\n **-** The third advantage is solving the problem of sequential requests. Look at the chaining and its description: The Effect listens to an Action and executes one or some Actions. And these are listened by some other Effect(s) that runs some new Action(s), being over and over processed by the reducers.\\n\\nThis cycle can have any length and it’s shown in Picture 5.\\n![3](/blog/content/images/2018/12/3.png)\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">Picture 5</p>\\n\\n **-** Along with the fact that the system is well-defined, we should mention the fourth advantage of the Redux approach: **business logic and rendering are distinct. The developers can test these sections independently from one another.**\\n \\nTesting our logic translates into testing of Actions, Selectors and, of course, Reducers, which are pure functions itself and allows us to test complex UIs by asserting that functions return specific data.\\n\\nBesides, you can get a great npm or browser extension for debugging process - Redux DevTools, and it can save you a lot of time. It’s possible to examine your whole workflow because each State and Action payload can be observed. In case the error message is sent back from the Reducer you can easily find out at which Action this error appeared.\\n\\nIn general, the Redux approach has got many advantages if compared with the custom state management approach. Of course, you will need some time for learning this methodology but as a result, it’s definitely worth it.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we shared our experience of managing the application State within several approaches. Literally, each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. You should decide which one is meeting your demands, take into account the use case, your organization's needs and restrictions.\\n\\nAs for us, the Redux methodology could be one of the best options because of its functionality and one-way data flow. The app processes become more predictable. Other pros are scalability, reusability, and additionally, it’s easy to understand how the data is shared among all the components and where it is usually stored.\\n\\nWell, you should opt for Redux only if you determine your project needs a state management tool. Otherwise, you can opt for other choices which were considered with their main pros and cons in this article. \\n\\nInfo for this article was taken from our blog on Medium - <u style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[check the link](https://medium.com/@2muchcoffee/angular-state-management-a-must-have-for-large-scale-angular-apps-8b98e5a761c7)</u> \"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Junior developers mostly work with small applications but when they start building large apps they encounter lots of issues the state management can solve.</p>\n<p>If you do many simple things which require much data manipulation, as a result, you may encounter data mutations and the appearance of side-effects.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t interested in wasting much time for solving such problems as fatigue bugs, and poor application performance you’d better learn about state management and figure out what state management options exist.</p>\n<p>As our team works with Angular we have already come through the same way of large app development and are going to consider all the options of handling a state management in the scope of Angular.<br>\nThis article provides you with essential tips and helps to choose the best option of the state management when building large-scale web apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"optionsofstatemanagementinangular\">Options of State Management in Angular</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/content/images/2018/12/options.png\" alt=\"Options of State Management in Angular\"></p>\n<p>There are 2 two built-in state functionality options Angular provides us with, and 2 more powerful and efficient options.

That solution should follow the DRY principle and make the State implementation reusable entirely through the Angular application that’s why at first, we have created a generic type Class (e.g. class StateManagement&lt;T.&gt;).</p>\n<p>Secondly, we have added a simple collection$ stream to this Class - it would represent the future data collections.

So, when comparing with the previous example all code that was responsible for managing the application State was declared only in one place. That could be called a significant enhancement but two main problems which appeared within this approach should be mentioned here, as well:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Combining different separate States</strong> - unfortunately, it’s very easy to get confused with many “CombineLatest” across the whole application. Because of this problem, the code becomes more complex and less readable.</li>\n<li><strong>Sequential requests and catching/processing errors</strong><br>\nAs an example, we wanted to get the State of Users and then to get a State for specific Invoices based on a current User Id. As the “StateManagement” Class is unified it becomes a problem to find a proper place for this specific request to be done and to catch/process its errors. Let’s imagine that our app is growing and getting new features. Where should we add more separate sequential requests? There can be no question of consistency of our code at all.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, the Observable Data Services are a good approach and a powerful solution which helps to use built-in features of Angular. You just need to take some points into account:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You should be very good at using RxJS library and Observable Pattern. You should know and distinguish the “cold”, “warm” and “hot” Observable. You have to know how to transform one into another, when to use and which one to use.</li>\n<li>The process of catching/handling errors and testing the app is not so easy - it’s pretty complicated to clarify whether it’s behaving according to specs.</li>\n<li>Remember that every solution is very custom, that’s why other developers should need time for understanding and maintaining it, especially if we talk about large apps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As it follows from the above there are some issues within this approach.

Let’s consider each of them:\n\n 1. Through hierarchical component’s interaction, typically use of “smart” and\n    “dumb” components via input bindings and custom events.\n 2. Through Angular services by using simple variables and Promises.\n 3. Through Observable data services.\n 4. Through Redux pattern.\n\nHierarchical component’s interaction\nAngular comes with a simple and clear interaction structure: a “stateful” parent\ncomponent delegates data down into “stateless” children components. Its pro is\ntesting simplicity and transparency: if there are some changes in a parent\ncomponent, you can easily track down which of the child components are\ninfluenced (see Picture 1).\n\n\nPicture 1\n\nIt’s a good solution if your app is simple. As soon as the architecture of this\napplication becomes more complex or if you want to share data between separate\nmodules/components through Angular services, this process becomes useless and\nconfusing (see Picture 2).\n\n\nPicture 2\n\nAngular services, variables & Promises\nThe current approach has some advantages and disadvantages. It’s possible to use\nthis approach but only within a very simple application. Let’s explain the\nreasons for such a statement.\n\nWhen talking about large applications we see some problems in using this\napproach. The first of them appears when using simple variables for temporary\ndata saving. It’s impossible simultaneously and over time to monitor data\nchanges in multiple separate components through Angular services properly.\nMoreover, there’s a huge chance of mutation the same data instance by reference\nin one of the components, which leads to unpredictable issues and consequences\nthrough the entire application.\n\nThe second weakness is Promises. As you know Angular offers support of\nObservables, which facilitates handling multiple values over time, the usage of\nPromises with its single values looks like a backward step!\n\nThe cons of Promises:\n\n * It’s impossible to run Promise every time you need it because it executes\n   instantly and only once - at the inception;\n * You can get only a single value or an error message from Promise;\n * You can’t cancel the request initiated from a Promise e.g. an HTTP request\n   that does a search on the key-up event would be executed as many times as we\n   press the key;\n * When you are trying to regain a retry capability of a failed call - this can\n   lead to a callback hell.\n\nIt follows from the above, that Promises have issues in large-scale apps,\nbesides, we lose a vast functionality when compared with the Observable pattern.\n\nThe two above mentioned built-in approaches for managing state can be used if\nthe application is not large. Let’s imagine that our app is growing and has a\nlot of components. That’s why we are going to consider another almost built-in\nAngular toolbox - RxJS.\n\nObservable Data Services - Angular services with RxJS\nRxJS might be a good solution to the issues concerning Promises and data\nchanging over time. Let’s consider what Observables data services are. These are\ndata streams which offer higher flexibility when creating an app and managing\nthe state of the app with help of multiple Angular services (singletons).\n\nThe Observable store pattern is a better solution and is more useful for simple\napps than a bulky third-party library store. But this approach has its cons, as\nwell. If you are developing an app and trying to carry out the custom state\nmanagement, you’ll miss the unified and centralized system in this approach.\n\nHere’s a simple app which was written on Angular 5 and RxJS 5.5.11 version. This\napp has got three main routes:\n\n * Customers - there is a list of customers with its details.\n * Products - there is a list of products with its details.\n * Invoices - there is a list on invoices and its details. Additionally, the\n   users can add a new invoice, as well as view, edit and remove a specific\n   invoice.\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class InvoicesService {\n  \n  passInvoicesRequest: Subject<any> = new Subject();\n  invoicesList$: ConnectableObservable<Invoice[]>;\n  invoicesListCombined$: Observable<Invoice[]>;\n  invoicesCollection$: ConnectableObservable<Invoice[]>;\n  \n  addInvoice$: Subject<Invoice> = new Subject();\n  addInvoiceToCollection$: Observable<any>;\n\n  deleteInvoice$: Subject<string> = new Subject();\n  deleteInvoiceOpenModal$: Subject<string> = new Subject();\n  deleteInvoiceFromCollection$: Observable<Invoice[]>;\n  deleteInvoiceModal$: ConnectableObservable<Invoice>;\n  \n  constructor(\n    private httpClient: HttpClient,\n    private customersService: CustomersService,\n    private productsService: ProductsService,\n    private modalBoxService: ModalBoxService,\n  ) {\n    // get initial invoices collection\n    this.invoicesList$ = this.passInvoicesRequest.pipe(\n      mergeScan(acc => acc ? Observable.of(acc) : this.getInvoicesRequest(), null),\n    ).publishReplay(1);\n    this.invoicesList$.connect();\n    \n    // add customer info to initial invoices collection\n    this.invoicesListCombined$ = combineLatest(\n      this.invoicesList$,\n      this.customersService.customersList$.pipe(take(1))\n    ).pipe(\n      map(([invoices, customers]) => invoices.map(invoice =>\n        ({\n          ...invoice,\n          customer: customers.find(customer => invoice.customer_id === customer._id),\n        }))\n      ),\n    );\n\n    // add a new invoice to a collection\n    this.addInvoiceToCollection$ = this.addInvoice$.pipe(\n      switchMap(newInvoice => this.invoicesCollection$.pipe(\n        withLatestFrom(this.customersService.customersList$),\n        map(([invoices, customers]) =>\n          [\n            ...invoices,\n            {\n              ...newInvoice,\n              customer: customers.find(customer => newInvoice['customer_id'] === customer._id)\n            },\n          ]\n        ),\n        take(1),\n      ))\n    );\n\n    // delete an invoice from collection\n    this.deleteInvoiceFromCollection$ = this.deleteInvoice$.pipe(\n      switchMap(id => this.invoicesCollection$.pipe(\n        map(invoices => invoices.filter(invoice => invoice._id !== id)),\n        take(1),\n      ))\n    );\n\n    // open delete-invoice modal window and send delete request to DB by confirm from user\n    this.deleteInvoiceModal$ = this.deleteInvoiceOpenModal$.pipe(\n      mergeMap(id => this.modalBoxService.confirmModal('Are you sure you want to delete an invoice?').pipe(\n        filter(choice => !!choice),\n        mapTo(id),\n      )),\n      switchMap(id => this.deleteInvoiceRequest(id)),\n      tap(invoices => this.modalBoxService.confirmModal(`Invoice number ${invoices._id} has been deleted`, false)),\n    ).publishReplay(1);\n    this.deleteInvoiceModal$.connect();\n\n    // main invoices collection to display\n    this.invoicesCollection$ = Observable.merge(\n      this.invoicesListCombined$.pipe(take(1)),\n      this.addInvoiceToCollection$,\n      this.deleteInvoiceFromCollection$,\n    ).publishReplay(1);\n    this.invoicesCollection$.connect();\n  }\n\n  getInvoicesRequest() {\n    return this.httpClient.get<Invoice[]>('invoices');\n  }\n\n  getInvoices() {\n    this.passInvoicesRequest.next();\n    return this.invoicesList$;\n  }\n\n  deleteInvoiceRequest(id) {\n    return this.httpClient.delete<Invoice>(`invoices/${id}`).pipe(\n      tap(deletedInvoice => this.deleteInvoice$.next(deletedInvoice._id))\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nWe should mention that this approach relies on pure RxJS streams.\n\nThe first step is to fetch data from API in invoicesList$ stream, then to pass\nits value (a collection of invoices) to invoicesListCombined$ stream (it\ncontains customersList$ stream (a collection of customers) declared in customers\nservice). This stream is just transforming every invoice by appending customer\ninfo to it.\n\nThen we’re going to carry out functionality within invoices in accordance with\nthe specs and to be able to expand it in the future.\n\nSo, the second step is to create the invoicesCollection$ base stream that has an\nasync subscription in a template for displaying a whole invoice list to the\nuser.\n\nAs you can see, this stream was expanded with 2 other streams:\naddInvoiceToCollection$ and deleteInvoiceFromCollection$, which accordingly\ntransform the data of the main invoicesCollection$ stream.\n\nThis approach is not so simple as you can imagine and we’ll tell you why.\n\n-  To use it, you should understand the RxJS operators very well;\n-  You have to define which streams are supposed to be “hot”, “cold” or “warm”\nand whether they are re-used in other services/components or not;\n-  It’s easy to get confused and after that, you’ll have to work a lot on\ndebugging.\n-  The main drawback of this approach is that it’s scalable just within this\ncurrent service and couldn’t be reusable. The reason is that you will have to\nrepeat and modify the ready code in the other service if you work with other\ndata.\n\nAlthough the above-mentioned approach is working really fast, we have tried to\nfind out a more efficient solution that could be scalable and reusable for the\nwhole app. We spent some time and found such a solution that unfortunately\nwasn’t worth that. That solution should follow the DRY principle and make the\nState implementation reusable entirely through the Angular application that’s\nwhy at first, we have created a generic type Class (e.g. class\nStateManagement<T.>).\n\nSecondly, we have added a simple collection$ stream to this Class - it would\nrepresent the future data collections. Each time when StateManagement Class is\ncalled through the “new” operator - a new instance of this Class would be\ncreated with new data inside of collection$ stream.\n\nexport class InvoiceService {\n\tstate: StateManagement<Invoice>;\nconstructor() {\nthis.state = new StateManagement<Invoice>();\n// this.state.collection$ would contain collection of invoices\n}\n}\n...\n\n\nThen, we added to the Class basic CRUD functions of persistent storage because\nwe wanted to be able to transform data in the future. So, when comparing with\nthe previous example all code that was responsible for managing the application\nState was declared only in one place. That could be called a significant\nenhancement but two main problems which appeared within this approach should be\nmentioned here, as well:\n\n 1. Combining different separate States  - unfortunately, it’s very easy to get\n    confused with many “CombineLatest” across the whole application. Because of\n    this problem, the code becomes more complex and less readable.\n 2. Sequential requests and catching/processing errors\n    As an example, we wanted to get the State of Users and then to get a State\n    for specific Invoices based on a current User Id. As the “StateManagement”\n    Class is unified it becomes a problem to find a proper place for this\n    specific request to be done and to catch/process its errors. Let’s imagine\n    that our app is growing and getting new features. Where should we add more\n    separate sequential requests? There can be no question of consistency of our\n    code at all.\n\nHowever, the Observable Data Services are a good approach and a powerful\nsolution which helps to use built-in features of Angular. You just need to take\nsome points into account:\n\n 1. You should be very good at using RxJS library and Observable Pattern. You\n    should know and distinguish the “cold”, “warm” and “hot” Observable. You\n    have to know how to transform one into another, when to use and which one to\n    use.\n 2. The process of catching/handling errors and testing the app is not so easy -\n    it’s pretty complicated to clarify whether it’s behaving according to specs.\n 3. Remember that every solution is very custom, that’s why other developers\n    should need time for understanding and maintaining it, especially if we talk\n    about large apps.\n\nAs it follows from the above there are some issues within this approach. Trying\nnot to do unnecessary work we were searching for another state management\nsolution and the eye-catching one was REDUX.\n\nRedux Pattern with RxJS\n\n\nAs described in the docs, Redux is \"a predictable state container for JavaScript\napps”. It offers an easy and very simple solution when data moves in one\ndirection only, it means that data flow is very predictable and explicit.\n\nHere are necessary definitions:\n\n * Component - view template user can interact with;\n * Action - defines (dispatches) the change in State that is to be made;\n * Reducer - a pure function, meaning, it doesn’t produce side effects , which\n   has access to the current State;\n * Selector - defines which specific data get from the Store;\n * Effect - handles everything that is asynchronous or outside the application.\n   \n\nPicture 3\n\nMaybe, it seems difficult and time-taking because you should set up the\nnecessary structure of the app and write much boilerplate code. But let’s find\nout how it works using this small example that helps to clarify everything and\ndemonstrates the benefits of this approach.\n\nWhen the user clicks the button in a component’s view template, the\ncorresponding Action is dispatched to the Store. When the action is initiated\nthe Reducer gets the current State and the data from the Action and then it\nbrings back the new State from it. Reducers don’t store or mutate State - they\njust take the previous State and the Action and give back the new State.\n\nLet’s consider the advantages of Redux:\n\n-  When you maintain all States in a Store and use the async pipe to wire up to\nthe view you are able to control the change detection that greatly improves the\nperformance in enterprise apps.\n\nAdditionally, Redux provides us with Selectors called with the Store’s select\nmethod (Picture 4)\n\n\nPicture 4\n\nThis Store’s select method helps to get the current State with a help of\nSelector that returns a stream. The last one brings back values whenever State\nchanges. This helps the component to be informed and receive the last data\nversion from the Store.\n\nAs you can see from the above-mentioned scheme, the data flow isn’t complicated\nat all and it’s very transparent. The reason is that the data always comes from\none source.\n\n-  Let’s talk about one more advantage. We have already mentioned above that\nthere is such an issue in the Observable Data Services approach as different\nseparate states’ combining. But the selectors easily solve this issue. They can\npass and сluster together various slices of the State for creating data which\nthe definite component needs.\n\n-  The third advantage is solving the problem of sequential requests. Look at\nthe chaining and its description: The Effect listens to an Action and executes\none or some Actions. And these are listened by some other Effect(s) that runs\nsome new Action(s), being over and over processed by the reducers.\n\nThis cycle can have any length and it’s shown in Picture 5.\n\n\nPicture 5\n\n-  Along with the fact that the system is well-defined, we should mention the\nfourth advantage of the Redux approach: business logic and rendering are\ndistinct. The developers can test these sections independently from one another.\n\nTesting our logic translates into testing of Actions, Selectors and, of course,\nReducers, which are pure functions itself and allows us to test complex UIs by\nasserting that functions return specific data.\n\nBesides, you can get a great npm or browser extension for debugging process -\nRedux DevTools, and it can save you a lot of time. It’s possible to examine your\nwhole workflow because each State and Action payload can be observed. In case\nthe error message is sent back from the Reducer you can easily find out at which\nAction this error appeared.\n\nIn general, the Redux approach has got many advantages if compared with the\ncustom state management approach. Of course, you will need some time for\nlearning this methodology but as a result, it’s definitely worth it.\n\nConclusion\nIn this article, we shared our experience of managing the application State\nwithin several approaches. Literally, each one has its own advantages and\ndisadvantages. You should decide which one is meeting your demands, take into\naccount the use case, your organization's needs and restrictions.\n\nAs for us, the Redux methodology could be one of the best options because of its\nfunctionality and one-way data flow. The app processes become more predictable.\nOther pros are scalability, reusability, and additionally, it’s easy to\nunderstand how the data is shared among all the components and where it is\nusually stored.\n\nWell, you should opt for Redux only if you determine your project needs a state\nmanagement tool. Otherwise, you can opt for other choices which were considered\nwith their main pros and cons in this article.\n\nInfo for this article was taken from our blog on Medium - check the link\n[https://medium.com/@2muchcoffee/angular-state-management-a-must-have-for-large-scale-angular-apps-8b98e5a761c7]","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/12/preview-1.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"State Management Tools for large-scale Angular Applications","meta_description":"You can either choose one of Angular built-in state management tools or opt for Observable Data Services (Angular services with RxJS) or Redux ","author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2018-12-06T15:47:51.000Z","created_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","updated_at":"2019-01-22T09:51:56.000Z","updated_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","published_at":"2018-12-06T16:53:18.000Z","published_by":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c7f7","custom_excerpt":"Angular offers 2 built-in solutions for state management: using stateful and stateless components or using simple variables for temporary data saving and Promises.","codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5c4ed5e0b2b386777533c84b","uuid":"0e6cd112-8ac3-4002-859d-a8e244f2c996","title":"How much does it cost to create an app like Spotify","slug":"cost-create-app-like-spotify","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"A music streaming platform Spotify came to the top within 10 years.

The cost will mostly depend on their hourly rate.\\n\\n*Secondly*, we should take into account all the components of the music app development.\\n\\nThe app development itself would be the biggest piece of work.

Have a look at the backend of Spotify. \\n\\nFor  Mac/Windows client Spotify uses C++, Java is used for Android and Objective-C for iOS applications. Spotify backend development uses so-called division based on features.

Here is a table showing how many hours approximately the developers would spend on which feature if it is developed for the native and cross-platform apps. \\n\\nWe want to mention several advantages of the cross-platform mobile app development:\\n*firstly*, the code base for both platforms is the same. So, approximate costs for the native app development will be higher than those for the cross-platform mobile app development. \\n*Secondly*, app development is much faster, therefore the product earlier comes to the market. \\n\\nYou should remember that time in the table can differ and depend on the complexity and your own requirements for the future music app. Anyway, this part of work is expected to be mostly time-consuming. \\n\\n**Features and tentative dates of the cross-platform and native mobile app development**\\n![table-1](/blog/content/images/2018/12/table-1.png)\\n\\nThe exact time can be decided only when you find the team and together with them set definite terms. \\n\\nRemember that you should invent additional unique features which are supposed to highlight your app and push it in front of the others. \\n\\n## Total cost for developing a music streaming app like Spotify\\n![Total-cost](/blog/content/images/2018/12/Total-cost.jpg)\\n\\nThe development costs vary and depend on many factors, features but let’s take the approximate cost of $40 hourly rate for evaluating the music streaming app price.\\n![table-2](/blog/content/images/2018/12/table-2.png)\\n\\nAs it follows from the above, if developing native apps for iOS and Android, the price would start **from $155.000** for both platforms. \\n\\nIf you choose cross-platform development the average costs decline and would start **from $125.000** and the app would be ready within a shorter period. \\n\\nAll the mentioned costs are very approximate and should be aligned with the development team. If we take as an example the design it would vary a lot depending on the clients’ desires.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n![conclusion](/blog/content/images/2018/12/conclusion.jpg)\\nIn this article, we considered the main costs for building the music streaming app like Spotify. As Spotify is unavailable in many countries there is a great unmet demand for the similar music application. \\n\\nWhen you start building the music streaming app you should take into account backend costs, costs for developing on Android and iOS and costs for additional tools. \\n\\nAnd beyond that, create additional features which make your app unique because building the clone music app is not a good idea. \\n\\nEstimating the total cost we took **the hourly rate of 40$** but these costs depend on the skills of developers and can vary.

And exactly it has become Spotify’s core feature.\\n* Another important feature is using the API of the Echo Nest for users to sign in. This technology is a music intelligence platform which: saves users’ time, helps to get their metadata, to find out about their behavior, to understand the musical taste of the customers basing on their previous choice and to personalize their playlists.\\n\\n## Pandora\\n\\n![pandora](/blog/content/images/2018/12/pandora.png)\\n\\n**Pandora** is both a music streaming and an internet radio service.\\nFounded in January 2000\\nWritten in Java\\n\\nThe recommendations Pandora makes differ from these of Spotify. Pandora uses the Music Genome Project, and it analyses music in a totally different way. Traits present in the tracks are analysed and then the analysis offers songs with similar tunes to the user. This feature is totally specific and unusual but sometimes users miss the opportunity to learn their friends’ preferences. \\n\\n## TuneIn\\n\\n![tunein](/blog/content/images/2018/12/tunein.png) \\n\\n**TuneIn** is a a radio music streaming service.\\nFounded in January 2002; \\n\\n* Users who usually listen to the radio live news, sports updates, podcasts, as well as music are pleased with this service. With it they can listen to the radio everywhere and create their own lists of preferred radio stations.\\n* Besides, the users are offered about 120,000 radio stations and this station is available in 22 countries and is translated into many languages. \\n* When entering a track or a band you would find radio stations in your country that are playing them. But you wouldn’t find a specific song because TuneIn is just a radio service, it doesn’t offer music player functions. If you ask yourself why TuneIn didn’t add more functions such as adding separate songs, remember: \\\"You know you've achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away.\\\"\\n \\n## SoundCloud\\n\\n![soundcloud](/blog/content/images/2018/12/soundcloud.png)\\n\\n**SoundCloud** is a music and podcast streaming platform.\\nFounded in August 2007\\nWritten in Ruby and Scala\\n\\n* When one user or artist publishes on SoundCloud he makes possible to download these episodes through the official SoundCloud app. SoundCloud uses not only RSS for disseminating podcasts and the users can connect directly with the others, interact with them on SC. The additional benefit is that such an approach solves Google podcast app problem which appears again and again.\\n* As it was mentioned above artists can upload and host their songs. So this platform additionally attracts beginning musicians, independent bands and artists.\\n\\n## iHeartRadio\\n\\n![iheartradio](/blog/content/images/2018/12/iheartradio.png)\\n\\n**iHeartRadio** is a radio app.\\nFounded in April 2008\\nIt was developed with many technologies such as Scala, Python, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Hadoop, ELK, Node.JS, React.JS, Swift.\\niHeartRadio is one of the best representatives of radio apps. \\n* And the first of its pros is - it supports a lot of devices.\\n* You can both listen to the radio over the internet, save stations and songs and make your own commercial-free custom station.

For users, musicians, for bands or for all of them? \\nBefore building your own music app you should research the market and define your target audience. Learn about the advantages of your competitors and find out what problems in present music apps the users have found. Read the reviews of leading music apps in the forums and think about how to solve existing problems. In drawbacks of other apps, you should find the possibilities for the development of your music app.\\n\\n* You should invent 1-2 unusual features (core features) which make your app different from the others. Check if the music app with such features attracts people: develop an MVP (minimum viable product) and bring it to the masses. If this idea seems interesting to users you would make the further strategy.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [How to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product): your Step-by-Step Guide](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-build-a-mvp/)</b>\\n\\n* The music app should find its specific niche otherwise it’s about everything and nothing.

With it they can listen to the\n   radio everywhere and create their own lists of preferred radio stations.\n * Besides, the users are offered about 120,000 radio stations and this station\n   is available in 22 countries and is translated into many languages.\n * When entering a track or a band you would find radio stations in your country\n   that are playing them. But you wouldn’t find a specific song because TuneIn\n   is just a radio service, it doesn’t offer music player functions. If you ask\n   yourself why TuneIn didn’t add more functions such as adding separate songs,\n   remember: \"You know you've achieved perfection in design, not when you have\n   nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away.\"\n\nSoundCloud\n\n\nSoundCloud  is a music and podcast streaming platform.\nFounded in August 2007\nWritten in Ruby and Scala\n\n * When one user or artist publishes on SoundCloud he makes possible to download\n   these episodes through the official SoundCloud app. SoundCloud uses not only\n   RSS for disseminating podcasts and the users can connect directly with the\n   others, interact with them on SC. The additional benefit is that such an\n   approach solves Google podcast app problem which appears again and again.\n * As it was mentioned above artists can upload and host their songs. So this\n   platform additionally attracts beginning musicians, independent bands and\n   artists.\n\niHeartRadio\n\n\niHeartRadio  is a radio app.\nFounded in April 2008\nIt was developed with many technologies such as Scala, Python, AWS, Kubernetes,\nDocker, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Hadoop, ELK, Node.JS, React.JS, Swift.\niHeartRadio is one of the best representatives of radio apps.\n\n * And the first of its pros is - it supports a lot of devices.\n * You can both listen to the radio over the internet, save stations and songs\n   and make your own commercial-free custom station. Many users consider it a\n   great advantage: you can listen to the songs without being interrupted by\n   ads.\n * One of its benefits is no need to create the account for listening to music.\n\nWhat are the essential tips for development of a successful music app?\n\n\n * Decide who is your app for? For users, musicians, for bands or for all of\n   them?\n   Before building your own music app you should research the market and define\n   your target audience. Learn about the advantages of your competitors and find\n   out what problems in present music apps the users have found. Read the\n   reviews of leading music apps in the forums and think about how to solve\n   existing problems. In drawbacks of other apps, you should find the\n   possibilities for the development of your music app.\n   \n   \n * You should invent 1-2 unusual features (core features) which make your app\n   different from the others. Check if the music app with such features attracts\n   people: develop an MVP (minimum viable product) and bring it to the masses.\n   If this idea seems interesting to users you would make the further strategy.\n   \n   \n\nAlso read our article: How to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product): your\nStep-by-Step Guide [https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-build-a-mvp/]\n\n * The music app should find its specific niche otherwise it’s about everything\n   and nothing. There should be nothing redundant in the music app. If it is\n   overcrowded with all possible features from all music apps the users just get\n   confused but don’t expect them to be interested in such an app.\n   \n   \n * You should always be aware of what the users dislike and consider removing\n   annoying things from your app. For example, in the world of pushy ads, the\n   app without boring commercials is a good find.\n   \n   \n * Of course, developing a music app for multiple platforms seems appealing. But\n   if you want your app to be available on many devices, you would need a lot of\n   money for investment and find many skilled developers. Or you should start\n   with a limited number of platforms. When talking about mobile devices, our\n   advice is to begin with the cross-platform mobile development\n   [https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development]: it would reduce costs and\n   save time compared with the native app development.\n   \n   \n\n  Also read our article where we counted costs for both native and\ncross-platform development for an app like Spotify:\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/cost-create-app-like-spotify/]\n\n * Make a note of such a feature as using API of the Echo Nest and social\n   networks’ API for users to sign in. In this way the app can get information\n   about the users, their preferences, learn what they like and dislike. The\n   tracks and artists would appear based on the users’ personal experience.\n   Besides, the users save time while signing in.\n\nIf you are about to develop a music app you should consider some things, e.g. on\nwhich server the music app should be hosted.\nAnother important thing to consider is where to store data - on the server (we\ndon’t recommend this option for several reasons) or choose the cloud storage\nservice (last time developing an app we chose AWS S3).\nRemember to create the database architecture with proper relationships. The\narchitecture of the powerful database should provide such relationships between\ndatabase tables that the app offers quick responses. Otherwise, you’ll have to\npay too much for hosting to speed up your app.\nOf course, all the technical nuances could be hardly mentioned in one article\nbut we have the good news for you: our team would be happy to explain all the\ntechnical nuances to you, and if you want, write us\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts]  to make your competitive app.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2018/12/preview3.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"How to make a competitive music app using the experience of the leading music apps","meta_description":"As Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, SoundCloud, and TuneIn succeeded product owners can succeed using them as an example.

Is there unmet demand in this area? What problem do the users have and how will your portal solve this problem? You should learn much information about the users and as consequence, understand what they are interested in and what they dislike.\\nAnalyzing similar platforms, their benefits and drawbacks would help you to answer this question.\\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Mobile application development: Top 9 steps to build your startup](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/)</b>\\n\\n**2 step: Decide the way of the <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[web development](https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development)</b></u> of an educational platform**\\n\\nThere are several ways of building an e-learning website. There is no right and wrong way, but each of them has pros and cons, and you should be aware of them. Consider the following options and pick one of them:  \\n\\n* Development the platform from scratch\\n\\nThis option means you would find a team which makes a totally new product without using a generic website or a CMS system. Only if you have great coding skills you can do it on your own. \\nThis way is time-consuming but advisable if you want to implement many custom features. It provides the users with the platform which has never existed before and is as customizable as you need it to be. This refers to tracking user behavior on the page, adding such options as you want etc. For example, in our educational platform we made specific ratings for students, progress tracking and its storage, a complicated counting system of this progress that was dependent on many factors.\\n\\n* Choosing one of the CMS systems: WordPress, Moodle etc.\\n\\nDeveloping the website with such a system you don’t need to have any coding skills. A lot of plugins offer customizability of CMS, and it’s free to start. It’s surely more affordable than the previous option. Of course, some costs should be spent if you order a paid theme or additional features. However, such systems have their limits and lack very important features which make the educational platform distinctive.\\n\\n* Ready to launch generic websites or teaching websites\\n\\nSuch websites can be launched very quickly and you can do it on your own. You would be offered several ready-to-use themes and such built-in features as student management, text and media addition, server, membership access, and database as a functionality. \\nBut the number of themes and many options are limited. You can only pick from features offered on the website. \\nThis would fit you if are trying to launch an educational platform with modest investments and to find out whether the interest from students is increasing. \\n\\n**3 step: Make a relevant content**\\n\\nThink of the relevant content and write down or create valuable information that should be placed on the website, these can be: \\n* Learning plans, \\n* Videos, \\n* Written exercises, \\n* Tests etc.\\n\\nCreating the content take into account that it should engage the students and not be boring. Use gamification for motivating students and provoking them to discover the new information.\\n\\n**4 step: Design an attractive UI/UX**\\n\\nThere are several rules on how a website should look like and what is unacceptable. UI/UX should be clear, contain colors motivating students to learn and not distracting them. The design should keep them engaged and concentrated. Depending on the target audience and the goals of the educational platform the design should be either serious or entertaining.\\nWe’ll tell much more about the aesthetically appealing UI/UX in one of our coming articles. \\n\\n**5 step: Develop an assessment system**\\n\\nThe assessment system can be interesting and motivating, e.g. in form of competition among many students. Divide the long stages into short ones and give rewards for passing each stage. The students should realize when and how their results would be measured.\\nThe tutors need to estimate the progress and achievements of their students, as well, so make a system that informs them about their students’ progress.\\n\\n**6 step: Motivate both tutors and students**\\n\\nAs it was already mentioned above, everything on the platform should provoke interest and motivate students for further learning. Gaining knowledge within the game is much more efficient than just learning that’s why consider adding gamification techniques to your educational platform. These can be rewards, mini-tests, and competition among students which increase engagement, awareness and productivity. \\nTutors can be motivated with the award system: non-material rewards or even with cash rewards.\\n\\n**7 step: Promote your e-learning platform**\\n\\nThink about how you would market your services. It’s a big part of work, but the most important things are: your courses should be relevant; the constant motivation should be present; setting purposes with timelines for studying which are promoted.\\n\\nWe mentioned the general tips for the educational platform building, but there are many nuances when the development begins and among them, there are definite technical nuances. \\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [How to create a Mobile Learning app: Essential Features, Tips, and Benefits of Educational apps](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/essential-features-tips-and-benefits-of-mobile-learning-apps/)</b>\\n\\n## Challenges and solutions\\n![challenges-and-solutions](/blog/content/images/2019/01/challenges-and-solutions.png)\\nOur team develops websites from scratch and this way has its benefits what was already mentioned above. \\nWhen we developed an e-learning platform we were able to implement very unusual features and thanks to them the e-learning platform was as customizable as the client wanted.\\nOf course, we faced challenges but thanks to our experience we were able to deal with them quickly.\\nAll the appearing challenges depend on the difficulty of the platform and skills of developers. Clients often face the situation when an issue isn’t addressed properly, and the code should be refactored then. That’s why much attention should be paid to the quality and professionalism. \\n\\nAs we wanted to deliver a quality platform, our experts not only implemented the functionalities but also analyzed the platform stack and suggested improvements.\\n\\n### Choosing backend\\n\\nThe client had some knowledge on the website building and made a proposal to build the backend using Firebase. The reasoning was it would be rather easy and wouldn’t require much code writing.\\n\\nAs the platform was expected to get many tutors and students the Web server should be able to handle many requests. Node.js ensures the performance and speed of the educational platform. \\nThat’s why after having considered all the requirements we chose Node.js to reach a high-performance platform. We opted for Nest.js - the framework of Node.js. It is more appropriate for API building and results in a quicker and more efficient development.\\nAnd MongoDB was chosen for storing data.\\n\\n### Payment services\\n![PAYMENT](/blog/content/images/2019/01/PAYMENT.png)\\nFirst, only Stripe was chosen and integrated as a payment system. But after some time we had to add Paypal under the request of the client. \\nIt was a complicated task to write such an algorithm that supports both of the payment systems. \\nOur team got this job done at the earliest time possible and for now, both payment systems are functioning stably and without issues. \\n\\nBesides, we suggested an additional option. As the educational platform would be available in many countries, the integration of the system for the tax calculation would be a must, so we gave advice to opt for Taxamo which turned out to be a good solution. \\n\\n### Email service\\n\\nThe client needed an email service for sending notifications. \\nThere were two options: a money-saving option - to choose a cost-free mailing or a paid option - to choose one of the paid services.\\nThe free mailing would lead to a new problem. Plenty of notifications coming to the mail would look like a mass e-mail. That’s why they would come to the spam folder and the client wouldn’t get them. \\n\\nWe strive to conserve our customers' resources so we recommended choosing Mailgun as a verified email service. This email service is available at the affordable price. It functions properly and there is spam protection when sending a lot of notifications so the users would surely get their e-mails. \\n\\n### Video content\\n![VIDEO-CONTENT](/blog/content/images/2019/01/VIDEO-CONTENT.png)\\nThe e-learning platform had a lot of content including the video content for students. Our first priority was to protect it so that the video content couldn’t be stolen if a wrong person got a link to the video. \\n\\nNest.js allowed dividing access according to the roles of users. We developed such an access system that only those users who bought these lessons could have access to the videos. Every user - a tutor, a student or an admin - got his role and according to it - his access levels. Other persons couldn’t watch videos when having a link.\\n\\n### Learner’s progress identification\\n\\n\\nThe complexity of this task was due to a very complex structure of the progress calculation. There were several categories with interdependencies; every one of them should contribute to the interim progress. And there was the general progress line. All the achievements should be displayed and influenced by tutors and students.\\nThere should appear such an algorithm that gathers all relationships and returns the current level to the user. \\n\\nWe developed such a calculation algorithm which accommodated all the interdependencies and delivered instant results.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n![CONCLUSION](/blog/content/images/2019/01/CONCLUSION.png)\\n2muchcoffee team helped the client quickly turn his startup idea into a fully functional educational platform that helps students gain knowledge and tutors teach various courses.\\nWe continue to support this e-learning platform. \\nWould you like to get more detailed information on this project? <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[Leave your contact info](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u>  and mark “educational platform” in the message line and we will send the detailed info to your e-mail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>The technological development gave us an opportunity for the distance learning.

Interest in e-learning platforms and the revenue from them are growing\nas quickly as the number of users striving to get the qualitative education.\nAccording to Statista research, the size of the e-learning market will grow and\nreach 243,8 billion U.S. dollars in 2022.\nJust look at the statistic:\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, the demand is growing, on the other hand, there are so many\nready platforms that creating a new top-notch project becomes more difficult\nthan before. There is a good chance that the new startup becomes just an\nordinary platform. So how to create and launch a unique thing that engages users\nand keeps them interested?\n\nSteps for building an e-learning platform\n\nIf you think that the work begins with coding we have news for you: much work\nhas to be done before starting with the development process. There are tips you\nshould consider when beginning your work on the new educational project:\n\n1 step: Define the goal and research your target audience\n\nHow will your platform help the users? Is there unmet demand in this area? What\nproblem do the users have and how will your portal solve this problem? You\nshould learn much information about the users and as consequence, understand\nwhat they are interested in and what they dislike.\nAnalyzing similar platforms, their benefits and drawbacks would help you to\nanswer this question.\n\nAlso read our article: Mobile application development: Top 9 steps to build\nyour\nstartup [https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/]\n\n2 step: Decide the way of the web development\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development]  of an educational platform\n\nThere are several ways of building an e-learning website. There is no right and\nwrong way, but each of them has pros and cons, and you should be aware of them.\nConsider the following options and pick one of them:\n\n * Development the platform from scratch\n\nThis option means you would find a team which makes a totally new product\nwithout using a generic website or a CMS system. Only if you have great coding\nskills you can do it on your own.\nThis way is time-consuming but advisable if you want to implement many custom\nfeatures. It provides the users with the platform which has never existed before\nand is as customizable as you need it to be. This refers to tracking user\nbehavior on the page, adding such options as you want etc. For example, in our\neducational platform we made specific ratings for students, progress tracking\nand its storage, a complicated counting system of this progress that was\ndependent on many factors.\n\n * Choosing one of the CMS systems: WordPress, Moodle etc.\n\nDeveloping the website with such a system you don’t need to have any coding\nskills. A lot of plugins offer customizability of CMS, and it’s free to start.\nIt’s surely more affordable than the previous option. Of course, some costs\nshould be spent if you order a paid theme or additional features. However, such\nsystems have their limits and lack very important features which make the\neducational platform distinctive.\n\n * Ready to launch generic websites or teaching websites\n\nSuch websites can be launched very quickly and you can do it on your own. You\nwould be offered several ready-to-use themes and such built-in features as\nstudent management, text and media addition, server, membership access, and\ndatabase as a functionality.\nBut the number of themes and many options are limited. You can only pick from\nfeatures offered on the website.\nThis would fit you if are trying to launch an educational platform with modest\ninvestments and to find out whether the interest from students is increasing.\n\n3 step: Make a relevant content\n\nThink of the relevant content and write down or create valuable information that\nshould be placed on the website, these can be:\n\n * Learning plans,\n * Videos,\n * Written exercises,\n * Tests etc.\n\nCreating the content take into account that it should engage the students and\nnot be boring. Use gamification for motivating students and provoking them to\ndiscover the new information.\n\n4 step: Design an attractive UI/UX\n\nThere are several rules on how a website should look like and what is\nunacceptable. UI/UX should be clear, contain colors motivating students to learn\nand not distracting them. The design should keep them engaged and concentrated.\nDepending on the target audience and the goals of the educational platform the\ndesign should be either serious or entertaining.\nWe’ll tell much more about the aesthetically appealing UI/UX in one of our\ncoming articles.\n\n5 step: Develop an assessment system\n\nThe assessment system can be interesting and motivating, e.g. in form of\ncompetition among many students. Divide the long stages into short ones and give\nrewards for passing each stage. The students should realize when and how their\nresults would be measured.\nThe tutors need to estimate the progress and achievements of their students, as\nwell, so make a system that informs them about their students’ progress.\n\n6 step: Motivate both tutors and students\n\nAs it was already mentioned above, everything on the platform should provoke\ninterest and motivate students for further learning. Gaining knowledge within\nthe game is much more efficient than just learning that’s why consider adding\ngamification techniques to your educational platform. These can be rewards,\nmini-tests, and competition among students which increase engagement, awareness\nand productivity.\nTutors can be motivated with the award system: non-material rewards or even with\ncash rewards.\n\n7 step: Promote your e-learning platform\n\nThink about how you would market your services. It’s a big part of work, but the\nmost important things are: your courses should be relevant; the constant\nmotivation should be present; setting purposes with timelines for studying which\nare promoted.\n\nWe mentioned the general tips for the educational platform building, but there\nare many nuances when the development begins and among them, there are definite\ntechnical nuances.\n\nAlso read our article: How to create a Mobile Learning app: Essential Features,\nTips, and Benefits of Educational apps\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/essential-features-tips-and-benefits-of-mobile-learning-apps/]\n\nChallenges and solutions\n\nOur team develops websites from scratch and this way has its benefits what was\nalready mentioned above.\nWhen we developed an e-learning platform we were able to implement very unusual\nfeatures and thanks to them the e-learning platform was as customizable as the\nclient wanted.\nOf course, we faced challenges but thanks to our experience we were able to deal\nwith them quickly.\nAll the appearing challenges depend on the difficulty of the platform and skills\nof developers. Clients often face the situation when an issue isn’t addressed\nproperly, and the code should be refactored then. That’s why much attention\nshould be paid to the quality and professionalism.\n\nAs we wanted to deliver a quality platform, our experts not only implemented the\nfunctionalities but also analyzed the platform stack and suggested improvements.\n\nChoosing backend\nThe client had some knowledge on the website building and made a proposal to\nbuild the backend using Firebase. The reasoning was it would be rather easy and\nwouldn’t require much code writing.\n\nAs the platform was expected to get many tutors and students the Web server\nshould be able to handle many requests. Node.js ensures the performance and\nspeed of the educational platform.\nThat’s why after having considered all the requirements we chose Node.js to\nreach a high-performance platform. We opted for Nest.js - the framework of\nNode.js. It is more appropriate for API building and results in a quicker and\nmore efficient development.\nAnd MongoDB was chosen for storing data.\n\nPayment services\n\nFirst, only Stripe was chosen and integrated as a payment system. But after some\ntime we had to add Paypal under the request of the client.\nIt was a complicated task to write such an algorithm that supports both of the\npayment systems.\nOur team got this job done at the earliest time possible and for now, both\npayment systems are functioning stably and without issues.\n\nBesides, we suggested an additional option. As the educational platform would be\navailable in many countries, the integration of the system for the tax\ncalculation would be a must, so we gave advice to opt for Taxamo which turned\nout to be a good solution.\n\nEmail service\nThe client needed an email service for sending notifications.\nThere were two options: a money-saving option - to choose a cost-free mailing or\na paid option - to choose one of the paid services.\nThe free mailing would lead to a new problem. Plenty of notifications coming to\nthe mail would look like a mass e-mail. That’s why they would come to the spam\nfolder and the client wouldn’t get them.\n\nWe strive to conserve our customers' resources so we recommended choosing\nMailgun as a verified email service. This email service is available at the\naffordable price. It functions properly and there is spam protection when\nsending a lot of notifications so the users would surely get their e-mails.\n\nVideo content\n\nThe e-learning platform had a lot of content including the video content for\nstudents. Our first priority was to protect it so that the video content\ncouldn’t be stolen if a wrong person got a link to the video.\n\nNest.js allowed dividing access according to the roles of users. We developed\nsuch an access system that only those users who bought these lessons could have\naccess to the videos. Every user - a tutor, a student or an admin - got his role\nand according to it - his access levels. Other persons couldn’t watch videos\nwhen having a link.\n\nLearner’s progress identification\nThe complexity of this task was due to a very complex structure of the progress\ncalculation. There were several categories with interdependencies; every one of\nthem should contribute to the interim progress. And there was the general\nprogress line. All the achievements should be displayed and influenced by tutors\nand students.\nThere should appear such an algorithm that gathers all relationships and returns\nthe current level to the user.\n\nWe developed such a calculation algorithm which accommodated all the\ninterdependencies and delivered instant results.\n\nConclusion\n\n2muchcoffee team helped the client quickly turn his startup idea into a fully\nfunctional educational platform that helps students gain knowledge and tutors\nteach various courses.\nWe continue to support this e-learning platform.\nWould you like to get more detailed information on this project?

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/2muchcoffee-react-scripts]\n\nNew project creation by using the CRA v.2 and the support of the decorator’s\nsyntax\n\nHead over to your terminal and run:\n(replace the “react-scripts-with-decorators” with your npm package name)\n\nnpx create-react-app test-app --scripts-version react-scripts-with-decorators\n\n\nUpdating the project created with the CRA v.2 for the decorator’s syntax support\n\nYou need to remove the “react-scripts” from the “package.json” file and\nnode_modules. After that, you have to install the “2muchcoffee-react-scripts”\n(here you should write your name for the npm package) by running the\n\nnpm install --save 2muchcoffee-react-scripts\n\ncommand in the terminal.\n\nConclusion\nIn general, a project fork is a great option, but not an ideal one - it\ndefinitely has nuances. In addition, you'll have to maintain your fork and make\nsure it is synced  within the upstream in order to have all the updates.\nBesides, there is a Backstroke [https://github.com/backstrokeapp/server]  - a\nbot that can help you to manage it.\n\nNevertheless, the CRA tool together with your custom “react-scripts” package\ncurrently is the best option for the build customization. It will help you and\nyour team easily to add all necessary configurations that are absent in\nout-of-the-box solutions or don’t meet your initial requirements.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2019/01/CreateReactApp.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Customizing Сreate React App without Eject - 2muchcoffee","meta_description":"CRA helps your team to add easily all necessary configurations which lack out of the box.

Enabling the Decorator’s syntax using Create React App (v2)\\n\\n**2.1 Enabling the Decorator’s syntax using Typescript:**\\n\\nUsing Typescript is the easiest way of enabling decorators in React because it doesn’t require any hacks or tricks. You only have to perform several actions:\\n\\n* run in the terminal: ```npx create-react-app my-typescript-app --typescript``` \\n* Reload compilerOptions in the “tsconfig.json” file by adding emitDecoratorMetadata and experimentalDecorators:\\n\\n```javascript\\n\\\"compilerOptions\\\": {\\n  \\\"target\\\": \\\"es5\\\",\\n  \\\"allowJs\\\": true,\\n  \\\"skipLibCheck\\\": false,\\n  \\\"esModuleInterop\\\": true,\\n  \\\"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\\\": true,\\n  \\\"emitDecoratorMetadata\\\": true,\\n  \\\"experimentalDecorators\\\": true,\\n  \\\"strict\\\": true,\\n  \\\"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\\\": true,\\n  \\\"module\\\": \\\"esnext\\\",\\n  \\\"moduleResolution\\\": \\\"node\\\",\\n  \\\"resolveJsonModule\\\": true,\\n  \\\"isolatedModules\\\": true,\\n  \\\"noEmit\\\": true,\\n  \\\"jsx\\\": \\\"preserve\\\"\\n  },\\n  ```\\n\\nLiterally, I find it one of the best options because I like Typescript. Using Typescript comes up with the benefit of linting your code, static-typing, and overall, better code quality. You can check out the example of using decorators with Typescript <a href=\\\"https://github.com/2muchcoffeecom/react-with-decorators/tree/typescript\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">*here.*</a>\\n\\n**2.2 Enabling the Decorator’s syntax using Fork**\\n\\nAs for me, the Fork method is the best choice for the build customization. Besides, this option is supported by Dan Abramov -  one of the influencers in the React team. The project fork is an alternative to Eject, other words to say, it doesn’t contain the cons of Eject, but has its own different nuances. You can find full details  <a href=\\\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/682\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">*here.*</a>  \\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also, please have a chance to read my article about [Customizing CRA without Eject](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/customizing-create-react-app-without-eject/)</b> \\nwhere you can find more detailed information on forking CRA repository and using it within your project.\\n\\n**2.3 Enabling the Decorator’s syntax using Eject**\\n\\nFor decorator enabling you should just follow a few steps:\\n* run in the command prompt:\\n > npm run eject\\n\\n* install babel plugins by executing the following commands: \\n\\n> npm i -D @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators \\n> @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties\\n\\n* update Babel in a package.json file by adding plugins to it:\\n```javascript\\n\\\"babel\\\": {\\n  \\\"plugins\\\": [\\n    [\\\"@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators\\\", { \\\"legacy\\\": true}],\\n    [\\\"@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties\\\", { \\\"loose\\\": true}]\\n  ],\\n  \\\"presets\\\": [\\n    \\\"react-app\\\"\\n  ]\\n},\\n```\\n\\nThis command will remove the single build dependency from your project. It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you’d have the full control over them. You can find an example of enabling the Decorator’s syntax using Eject <a href=\\\"https://github.com/2muchcoffeecom/react-with-decorators/tree/eject\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">*here.*</a>\\n\\n**2.4 Enabling the Decorator’s syntax using the “customize-cra” npm package**\\n\\nIf you create the project by using the ```npx create-react-app my-app``` command, then you won’t have a chance to use decorators out-of-the-box. And in order to do it, you need to install the “customize-cra” package. You can find an example <a href=\\\"https://github.com/2muchcoffeecom/react-with-decorators/tree/customize-cra\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">*here*</a>.\\n\\nThen you should update devDependencies in the “package.json” file by adding to it 2 packages - “customize-cra” and “react-app-rewired”. A second package is necessary to enable the 1st package.\\n\\n```javascript\\n\\\"devDependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"customize-cra\\\": \\\"^0.2.8\\\",\\n  \\\"react-app-rewired\\\": \\\"^1.6.2\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfterward, you should update the scripts in the “package.json” file by replacing react-scripts with “react-app-rewired”.\\n\\n```javascript\\n\\\"scripts\\\": {\\n  \\\"start\\\": \\\"react-app-rewired start\\\",\\n  \\\"build\\\": \\\"react-app-rewired build\\\",\\n  \\\"test\\\": \\\"react-app-rewired test\\\",\\n  \\\"eject\\\": \\\"react-scripts eject\\\"\\n},\\n```\\n\\nFinally, add a “config-overrides.js” file to the root of the project that enables the Decorator’s syntax. File contents:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst {\\n override,\\n addDecoratorsLegacy\\n} = require(\\\"customize-cra\\\");\\n\\nmodule.exports = override(\\n addDecoratorsLegacy(),\\n);\\n```\\nThat is an easy way of enabling the Decorator’s syntax as it requires minimal changes in the project. However, such an approach has its own consequences: it might stop working within future versions of the “react-scripts”. And if it happens, you’d have to use the “Eject” or “Fork” approaches described above.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAll in all, as you know decorators provide us with many benefits and the possibility to derive a profit from their vast functionality is a great chance for any developer. In this article, I’ve revealed several approaches of enabling the Decorator’s syntax in React application and considered the benefits and drawbacks they have.\\n\\tIt’s totally up to you what approach to choose, my main point is: be on a roll - implement, use and retrieve all benefits from decorators now. \"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>I have been working as an Angular developer for more than 3 years now and have always been excited by the many out-of-the-box solutions that are offered by an Angular framework.</p>\n<p>Today, I’ve decided to tell you about Decorators - one of the most fundamental parts in Angular and how to incorporate this feature into React.

It will\ncopy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack,\nBabel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you’d have the full control over\nthem. You can find an example of enabling the Decorator’s syntax using Eject \nhere. [https://github.com/2muchcoffeecom/react-with-decorators/tree/eject]\n\n2.4 Enabling the Decorator’s syntax using the “customize-cra” npm package\n\nIf you create the project by using the npx create-react-app my-app  command,\nthen you won’t have a chance to use decorators out-of-the-box. And in order to\ndo it, you need to install the “customize-cra” package. You can find an example \nhere\n[https://github.com/2muchcoffeecom/react-with-decorators/tree/customize-cra].\n\nThen you should update devDependencies in the “package.json” file by adding to\nit 2 packages - “customize-cra” and “react-app-rewired”. A second package is\nnecessary to enable the 1st package.\n\n\"devDependencies\": {\n  \"customize-cra\": \"^0.2.8\",\n  \"react-app-rewired\": \"^1.6.2\"\n}\n\n\nAfterward, you should update the scripts in the “package.json” file by replacing\nreact-scripts with “react-app-rewired”.\n\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"react-app-rewired start\",\n  \"build\": \"react-app-rewired build\",\n  \"test\": \"react-app-rewired test\",\n  \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\n},\n\n\nFinally, add a “config-overrides.js” file to the root of the project that\nenables the Decorator’s syntax. File contents:\n\nconst {\n override,\n addDecoratorsLegacy\n} = require(\"customize-cra\");\n\nmodule.exports = override(\n addDecoratorsLegacy(),\n);\n\n\nThat is an easy way of enabling the Decorator’s syntax as it requires minimal\nchanges in the project. However, such an approach has its own consequences: it\nmight stop working within future versions of the “react-scripts”. And if it\nhappens, you’d have to use the “Eject” or “Fork” approaches described above.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, as you know decorators provide us with many benefits and the\npossibility to derive a profit from their vast functionality is a great chance\nfor any developer. In this article, I’ve revealed several approaches of enabling\nthe Decorator’s syntax in React application and considered the benefits and\ndrawbacks they have.\nIt’s totally up to you what approach to choose, my main point is: be on a roll -\nimplement, use and retrieve all benefits from decorators now.","feature_image":"/blog/content/images/2019/01/ES7Decorators.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"ES7 Decorators: be on a roll, use decorators in React now!","meta_description":"The decorators provide you with the vast functionality.

Depending on the purpose of your app you may pick one or several gamification components.\\n\\nAs you can see gamification elements are worth adding to the app and the famous apps have realized how to become popular with this trend. \\n\\n## Gamification tactics used by the world-known apps\\n\\nLook at the world-known apps and learn how gamification contributed to their popularity growth. We are going to analyze an e-learning app Duolingo, a ride-hailing service Uber and an e-commerce website Aliexpress. Every one of them used gamification in its own way but without the chosen features they wouldn’t reach their popularity.\\n\\n### Gamification in the learning app Duolingo\\n![duolingo](/blog/content/images/2019/01/duolingo.png)\\nDuolingo is a language-learning platform which includes a language-learning website and an app, as well as a digital language proficiency assessment exam. It created such an interesting learning process that even its beta version accumulated a waiting list of more than 300,000 users.\\nWant to know why?\\nLearning a language feels like playing a game because this app offers a lot of gamification elements. The beginning users go through a simple funny test and start earning XP (experience points). \\nThe users can’t access all the features at the beginning: they need to gather skills. \\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Also read our article: [Mobile application development: Top 9 steps to build your startup](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/)</b>\\n\\nBesides, Duolingo offers you to create a club and interact with other users. Peer pressure is a motivating element that’s why you can see leaders on the leaderboards and compete against your friends. \\nAnother gamification feature is badges users get for their achievements and completing objectives and challenges.\\n\\nAnd what about social interaction? Duolingo gives you an opportunity to share your experience and achievements with friends.\\n\\nThe design of the app makes the users forget about boring learning. Every detail gives you the impression that you are doing it just for fun. Colors are bright and cheerful. Each word is both written and provided with an image with bright colors. \\n\\nThe students acquire in-app currency called \\\"lingots\\\". With their help, users can open additional levels or customize characters.\\n \\nAltogether it is something that creates massive excitement in the game. Users don’t understand they are learning, they feel they are having fun. \\nDuolingo has become one of the most popular learning apps in the world because it benefited from gamification and used all its aspects. As a result, the app is loved and being used by more than 300,000 users in the whole world.\\n\\n### How is Uber using gamification?\\n![uber](/blog/content/images/2019/01/uber.png)\\nWith regard to the ride-hailing service Uber, it’s a fully different app taking the different niche but they use gamification elements, as well. \\nTrying to make the service work quickly Uber does everything to engage and motivate drivers. Have a look at the gaming elements of Uber:\\nAs a reward, the drivers earn badges named “Entertaining Drive”,  “Great Conversation” etc. The last studies proved that such badges are often just as motivating as cash rewards.\\n\\nAnother motivating element is called “forward dispatch”. The drivers get a new job before the previous one has finished. This trick has an addictive effect because drivers start taking one job after the other one without a break. Because of this unexpected effect, later, Uber had to add a reminder that drivers should have a rest.\\n\\nIn addition to it, Uber offers such motivating quests as completing several rides in a certain number of hours to earn a bonus of $X. If the drivers try to log out they get a message how close they are to completing a quest.\\nThere arose some disputes whether such tricks belong to manipulations, and we can’t give an answer to this question but we can ascertain the fact: Uber has achieved the dizzy success and has become a leader in its niche very quickly.\\n\\n### Examples of gamification in Aliexpress \\n![aliexpress](/blog/content/images/2019/01/aliexpress.png)\\nOf course, the concept of gamification has come to e-commerce. Many retail companies use gamification in their apps to increase sales and AliExpress is no different. \\n\\nAliexpress offers many different kinds of games and tasks. How does the marketplace benefit from these games? Users play the games and experience positive emotions that leads to repeated use of this app. Besides, they can exchange the coins for coupons and it motivates them to make purchases. Additionally, Aliexpress promotes its new product categories offering the users to check the new category. \\nThere are several types of games but the general goal of the marketplace is that between the games users are reminded of the marketplace as non-intrusive as possible. \\n\\nAs you can see, the top platforms and apps use all possible gamification aspects and elements. Let’s move on to our experience as we have worked with many startups which are now successful because of gamification use, as well. \\n\\n## Our best startup experiences\\n\\nAlmost every app or platform we developed had features of gamification of one form or another. \\nEvery business owner wants to make it big and of course, he should use all possible ways and trends for it. \\nBut working at the <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[app development](https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development)</b></u> be careful with gamification: there are apps which should use all possible gamification features - the users will see such apps as entertainment apps (even if they are for educational purpose) and there are platforms or apps which take only a few gamification features (for example business apps) because creating the structure of video games would be generally inappropriate.\\nDeveloping our apps we used all popular concepts of gamification. Let me tell you about a lifestyle app and an educational platform developed by our company.\\n\\n### Educational platform \\n![education](/blog/content/images/2019/01/education.png)\\nMaybe you look at the example of Duolingo and think the more gamification in the learning app the better. But everything depends on the goals and impression you want to provide with your app/platform. \\nWe developed an educational platform which positions itself as a serious sketching platform in the global market. After finishing its courses the students would find well-paid jobs. \\nToo much gamification would look like a kindergarten class and without gamification the learning process usually becomes boring.\\nIn this case, it has been decided not to bring too much of gamification because its features should motivate and engage students and not distract them. \\n\\n<b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">Read our article: [How to develop an e-learning platform: steps, challenges and solutions](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-develop-an-e-learning-platform/)</b>\\n\\nAs the platform creates an image of prestigious courses, the design is serious and laconic and gamification features are a humble addition to the general design. \\nThere is an in-app currency (credits) and XP points (experience); gathering XPs the students open new levels, and it motivates them to the future achievements. \\nThere are levels and you come to the new one only having passed the previous one. \\nStudents can see their progress line, their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nDo you remember that social interaction is one of gamification features? The platform uses it, as well: the students are pleased to share achievements with friends and tell they attend prestigious courses and have certain achievements! Additionally, the platform benefits from being advertised by its users to their friends.\\nAll together it presents the educational platform as providing a serious and promising education but in an interesting way.\\nWould you like to get more detailed information on this project? <u><b>[Leave your contact info](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u> and mark “educational platform” in the message and we will send the detailed info on this case to your e-mail.\\n\\n### Lifestyle app  \\n![lifestyle](/blog/content/images/2019/01/lifestyle.png)\\nAnother app our company has developed is a lifestyle app. Our purpose was to develop an app which connects people offering services and people who need such services. If somebody needs a teacher/nurse/plumber/electrician/cleaner etc., he or she searches in the relevant category. \\nThis app isn’t designed for entertainment and gamification shouldn’t distract the users from the main goal: hiring personnel or finding a job. But it shouldn’t be banal and should stand out among other similar apps in its niche. \\nThe gamification mission is both clients and workers should be willing to use the app. So, what gamification system was developed there?\\n\\nEverybody knows how boring a job search could be. So, this app tried to diversify this process. Workers are motivated to do their best because they get likes from satisfied clients, and workers with the best ratings come on top of the list. Additionally, workers get in-app badges and scores what tends to be not less motivating than a cash payment.\\nMoreover, the app pushes the workers to improve their skills that’s why there are different levels from the beginner to the professional. But this process doesn’t look very dryly. In contrast, the workers get stars and scores and can customize their profiles coming to the new level. \\n\\nThe client gets points when ordering service and after having gathered many points he can get a discount, pay for the next service order with these points or get a cashback. Clients get a reminder of how close they are to getting a discount or a certain cashback. \\nThe design is rather laconic because the gamification is a supplement only and doesn't distract from the main purpose: searching for a job or hiring personnel.\\nSuch a gamification strategy has already paid off because this app has become very popular in its country.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGamification is a new and popular trend. It should be used in the app or platform for fostering competitiveness because without the gamification elements the app tends to be boring and dull. \\nAs it has already been established that gamification enhances user engagement we advise to pick certain features of it and use them in your app.\\n\\nNevertheless, use it wisely because not all the gamification aspects have to be placed in every type of apps. Depending on its goal the app or the platform serves for entertainment or for serious purposes. If the goal is not only entertainment be carefully and don’t bring too much of gamification elements: they may become a distracting and annoying thing. \\nThe lifestyle app and educational platform developed by us have become popular and successful.\\n\\nRemember the main goal: gamifying should engage users and push them to the continuous use of an app. Its features should look appropriate in a certain startup.\\nWant to develop and gamify your app? <u><b>[Feel free to contact our team!](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u> \\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Nowadays if the product owner wants to make an app which defeats competition he or she should be ready to use the newest trends in his or her app. And one of such trends is gamification.<br>\nIn this article, you’ll learn how gamification helped world-famous apps to come to the top, what gamifying elements were included to successful apps developed by our company and why too much gamification is not always a good thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gamificationasapopulartrend\">Gamification as a popular trend</h2>\n<p><strong>Gamification</strong> is the application of game design elements and game principles in non-game contexts.<br>\nGamification has come to all spheres of our life.

Depending on the purpose of your app\nyou may pick one or several gamification components.\n\nAs you can see gamification elements are worth adding to the app and the famous\napps have realized how to become popular with this trend.\n\nGamification tactics used by the world-known apps\nLook at the world-known apps and learn how gamification contributed to their\npopularity growth. We are going to analyze an e-learning app Duolingo, a\nride-hailing service Uber and an e-commerce website Aliexpress. Every one of\nthem used gamification in its own way but without the chosen features they\nwouldn’t reach their popularity.\n\nGamification in the learning app Duolingo\n\nDuolingo is a language-learning platform which includes a language-learning\nwebsite and an app, as well as a digital language proficiency assessment exam.\nIt created such an interesting learning process that even its beta version\naccumulated a waiting list of more than 300,000 users.\nWant to know why?\nLearning a language feels like playing a game because this app offers a lot of\ngamification elements. The beginning users go through a simple funny test and\nstart earning XP (experience points).\nThe users can’t access all the features at the beginning: they need to gather\nskills.\n\nAlso read our article: Mobile application development: Top 9 steps to build\nyour\nstartup [https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/]\n\nBesides, Duolingo offers you to create a club and interact with other users.\nPeer pressure is a motivating element that’s why you can see leaders on the\nleaderboards and compete against your friends.\nAnother gamification feature is badges users get for their achievements and\ncompleting objectives and challenges.\n\nAnd what about social interaction? Duolingo gives you an opportunity to share\nyour experience and achievements with friends.\n\nThe design of the app makes the users forget about boring learning. Every detail\ngives you the impression that you are doing it just for fun. Colors are bright\nand cheerful. Each word is both written and provided with an image with bright\ncolors.\n\nThe students acquire in-app currency called \"lingots\". With their help, users\ncan open additional levels or customize characters.\n\nAltogether it is something that creates massive excitement in the game. Users\ndon’t understand they are learning, they feel they are having fun.\nDuolingo has become one of the most popular learning apps in the world because\nit benefited from gamification and used all its aspects. As a result, the app is\nloved and being used by more than 300,000 users in the whole world.\n\nHow is Uber using gamification?\n\nWith regard to the ride-hailing service Uber, it’s a fully different app taking\nthe different niche but they use gamification elements, as well.\nTrying to make the service work quickly Uber does everything to engage and\nmotivate drivers. Have a look at the gaming elements of Uber:\nAs a reward, the drivers earn badges named “Entertaining Drive”, “Great\nConversation” etc. The last studies proved that such badges are often just as\nmotivating as cash rewards.\n\nAnother motivating element is called “forward dispatch”. The drivers get a new\njob before the previous one has finished. This trick has an addictive effect\nbecause drivers start taking one job after the other one without a break.\nBecause of this unexpected effect, later, Uber had to add a reminder that\ndrivers should have a rest.\n\nIn addition to it, Uber offers such motivating quests as completing several\nrides in a certain number of hours to earn a bonus of $X. If the drivers try to\nlog out they get a message how close they are to completing a quest.\nThere arose some disputes whether such tricks belong to manipulations, and we\ncan’t give an answer to this question but we can ascertain the fact: Uber has\nachieved the dizzy success and has become a leader in its niche very quickly.\n\nExamples of gamification in Aliexpress\n\nOf course, the concept of gamification has come to e-commerce. Many retail\ncompanies use gamification in their apps to increase sales and AliExpress is no\ndifferent.\n\nAliexpress offers many different kinds of games and tasks. How does the\nmarketplace benefit from these games? Users play the games and experience\npositive emotions that leads to repeated use of this app. Besides, they can\nexchange the coins for coupons and it motivates them to make purchases.\nAdditionally, Aliexpress promotes its new product categories offering the users\nto check the new category.\nThere are several types of games but the general goal of the marketplace is that\nbetween the games users are reminded of the marketplace as non-intrusive as\npossible.\n\nAs you can see, the top platforms and apps use all possible gamification aspects\nand elements. Let’s move on to our experience as we have worked with many\nstartups which are now successful because of gamification use, as well.\n\nOur best startup experiences\nAlmost every app or platform we developed had features of gamification of one\nform or another.\nEvery business owner wants to make it big and of course, he should use all\npossible ways and trends for it.\nBut working at the app development\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development]  be careful with gamification:\nthere are apps which should use all possible gamification features - the users\nwill see such apps as entertainment apps (even if they are for educational\npurpose) and there are platforms or apps which take only a few gamification\nfeatures (for example business apps) because creating the structure of video\ngames would be generally inappropriate.\nDeveloping our apps we used all popular concepts of gamification. Let me tell\nyou about a lifestyle app and an educational platform developed by our company.\n\nEducational platform\n\nMaybe you look at the example of Duolingo and think the more gamification in the\nlearning app the better. But everything depends on the goals and impression you\nwant to provide with your app/platform.\nWe developed an educational platform which positions itself as a serious\nsketching platform in the global market. After finishing its courses the\nstudents would find well-paid jobs.\nToo much gamification would look like a kindergarten class and without\ngamification the learning process usually becomes boring.\nIn this case, it has been decided not to bring too much of gamification because\nits features should motivate and engage students and not distract them.\n\nRead our article: How to develop an e-learning platform: steps, challenges and\nsolutions [https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/how-to-develop-an-e-learning-platform/]\n\nAs the platform creates an image of prestigious courses, the design is serious\nand laconic and gamification features are a humble addition to the general\ndesign.\nThere is an in-app currency (credits) and XP points (experience); gathering XPs\nthe students open new levels, and it motivates them to the future achievements.\nThere are levels and you come to the new one only having passed the previous\none.\nStudents can see their progress line, their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nDo you remember that social interaction is one of gamification features? The\nplatform uses it, as well: the students are pleased to share achievements with\nfriends and tell they attend prestigious courses and have certain achievements!\nAdditionally, the platform benefits from being advertised by its users to their\nfriends.\nAll together it presents the educational platform as providing a serious and\npromising education but in an interesting way.\nWould you like to get more detailed information on this project? Leave your\ncontact info [https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts]  and mark “educational platform”\nin the message and we will send the detailed info on this case to your e-mail.\n\nLifestyle app\n\nAnother app our company has developed is a lifestyle app. Our purpose was to\ndevelop an app which connects people offering services and people who need such\nservices. If somebody needs a teacher/nurse/plumber/electrician/cleaner etc., he\nor she searches in the relevant category.\nThis app isn’t designed for entertainment and gamification shouldn’t distract\nthe users from the main goal: hiring personnel or finding a job. But it\nshouldn’t be banal and should stand out among other similar apps in its niche.\nThe gamification mission is both clients and workers should be willing to use\nthe app. So, what gamification system was developed there?\n\nEverybody knows how boring a job search could be. So, this app tried to\ndiversify this process. Workers are motivated to do their best because they get\nlikes from satisfied clients, and workers with the best ratings come on top of\nthe list. Additionally, workers get in-app badges and scores what tends to be\nnot less motivating than a cash payment.\nMoreover, the app pushes the workers to improve their skills that’s why there\nare different levels from the beginner to the professional. But this process\ndoesn’t look very dryly. In contrast, the workers get stars and scores and can\ncustomize their profiles coming to the new level.\n\nThe client gets points when ordering service and after having gathered many\npoints he can get a discount, pay for the next service order with these points\nor get a cashback. Clients get a reminder of how close they are to getting a\ndiscount or a certain cashback.\nThe design is rather laconic because the gamification is a supplement only and\ndoesn't distract from the main purpose: searching for a job or hiring personnel.\nSuch a gamification strategy has already paid off because this app has become\nvery popular in its country.\n\nConclusion\nGamification is a new and popular trend. It should be used in the app or\nplatform for fostering competitiveness because without the gamification elements\nthe app tends to be boring and dull.\nAs it has already been established that gamification enhances user engagement we\nadvise to pick certain features of it and use them in your app.\n\nNevertheless, use it wisely because not all the gamification aspects have to be\nplaced in every type of apps. Depending on its goal the app or the platform\nserves for entertainment or for serious purposes. If the goal is not only\nentertainment be carefully and don’t bring too much of gamification elements:\nthey may become a distracting and annoying thing.\nThe lifestyle app and educational platform developed by us have become popular\nand successful.\n\nRemember the main goal: gamifying should engage users and push them to the\ncontinuous use of an app. Its features should look appropriate in a certain\nstartup.\nWant to develop and gamify your app?

We saw many startups fail because their implementation was so poor and the performance of the app was very bad. It doesn’t matter whether you create a mobile app or a website, the beautiful and simple design enhances user engagement and the bad design makes the users abandon the app. \\n\\nIn this article we are going to tell how to avoid mistakes in the UI/UX design. Reading about the web or app design in Google you find words UI/UX. Let’s clarify what they mean.\\nUI is a user interface, and UX stands for user experience. \\nAll visual components the user is interacting with: the typography, images etc. belong to UI. \\nTo UX belong the analytical part of the designer work, research, the target audience definition, competitor analysis, testing, creating user flow and user persona. \\n\\nThe appealing <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[UI/UX design](https://2muchcoffee.com/design)</b></u> is focused on maximizing usability and getting a positive user experience. Its main purpose is to be user-friendly for making the user's interaction simple and efficient, in terms of accomplishing user goal. \\nThe process of the UI/UX creation is comprehensive because they are two halves of the same thing.\\n\\nOf course, firstly, you should learn and follow the steps of the app development. It’s not the design you start with. It’s defining your app’s goal, analysing your competitors and researching the target audience.\\nMore precise information on the steps for the mobile app development you find in the article <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[Mobile application development: Top 9 steps to build your startup](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/)</b></u>.\\n\\nSo why is the good UI/UX design so important? \\n\\n* It increases your revenue and fosters interest in the website or the app, encourages to start using services or products. It doesn’t matter whether you are offering products or services the users are more likely to try out using the well-designed app or website. \\n* The well-designed app converts users much better than a bad-designed one. The conversion is completing the desired goal by a visitor on your website.\\n* The user-friendly app or website provokes interest and people repeatedly use it.\\n* If you have an app with the bad design you may redesign it later, otherwise, your project fails. As you understand it’s a money waste.\\n\\nMaybe you have invented a great startup but the customers can’t discover your ideas because they are scared off with loud colors, content overload or low performance.\\n\\nThe users nowadays have so many options to choose from that they wouldn’t wade through your app in order to search for the needed information.\\n\\n**Table of contents**\\n\\nGeneral problems\\n* Visual/content overload\\n* Non-predictable elements\\n* Incredible design vs. low performance\\n* Non-optimized form\\n* Poor navigation\\n* Non-responsive website \\n\\nAesthetic issues:\\n* Unreadable typography \\n* Wrong images\\n* Thrilling or pale colors\\n\\nIf you are going to develop your app/ website, you should know what the conversion depends on. And it’s the design that makes an important contribution to the conversion rate.\\nNow it’s time to consider the mistakes in the design creation and tell how to solve them.\\n\\n## General problems\\n\\n### Visual/content overload\\n![overload](/blog/content/images/2019/01/overload.png)\\nMany business owners want to include to their app as much information as possible. When we are trying to decrease loads of symbols vs. information vs. images in the homepage the client tells us: “Everything is very important”, and then he adds: “Besides, I want to include these links, one more pop up and 5 very important paragraphs of text!”\\n\\nIn our era of information overload, not many people know about the importance of the empty space in the app.\\n**The empty space** is a white space between information blocks.\\nIf your app lacks “the white space” the users perceive information with great difficulty. And vice versa: if the empty space is properly placed the users structure the information more clearly. \\n\\n**The reading content** should be optimized and the most important information should be highlighted.\\nIf the users can’t concentrate on the most important feature because of the visual or content overload, would they spend their time on the incomprehensible app or would they visit your competitors?\\n**Pop-ups:** they can be annoying. Especially if the users haven’t seen the content of the website yet and are suddenly interrupted with a pop-up. \\n**The paradox of choice:** if the users have to choose from too many options, they don’t choose a single one.\\n\\n**Fix:**\\n* Give the people some time for reading before they are interrupted with a pop up; don’t create too many popups. 1-2 pop-ups are enough, otherwise, you build a non-user-friendly website.  \\n* Keep your design as simple as possible. Look through the eyes of people who should be interested in your app, not scared off with a lot of UI elements.\\n* Define what things are really important. What should be highlighted and quickly found by the customers and what is an unnecessary option?\\n* You should decide the feature importance hierarchy and be ready to inform your designer about it.\\n* So don’t add too many functions, options and items especially to the home page.\\n* Remember to create calls-to-action: “Contact us!” “Read the book here” “Download the film right now” etc.\\n\\n### Non-predictable elements\\n![non-predictable-elements](/blog/content/images/2019/01/non-predictable-elements.png)\\nSometimes you find symbols in the app/website which aren’t clear at all. \\nActually, it relates not only to symbols. There are buttons or other objects whose designation isn’t clear. On the contrary, there are certain icons or buttons the users got used to seeing in certain places. \\nIf you didn’t create self-explanatory symbols and don’t give any hint what they are for the users get confused. \\n\\nAnother problem is changing the meaning of the well-known symbols. We don’t recommend to do it. For example, we created <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[an e-commerce platform](https://2muchcoffee.com/ecommerce-saas/)</b></u> where the business owner wanted to seem original and unique. He planned to change all the usual symbols (shopping cart, search etc.) and replace them with his own symbols. Surely, it would distract users from their main goal - shopping that’s why the symbols weren’t changed.\\n\\n**Fix:** Use well-known symbols and don’t change their meaning. If you want to add an unknown element, firstly, explain or give a hint when hovering a mouse on it. Collect feedback from users, who belong to your target audience and find out what icon disturbs or distracts them.\\n\\n### Incredible design vs. low performance\\n![incredible](/blog/content/images/2019/01/incredible.png)\\nWe understand that our clients want to make a very appealing UI/UX design. But you should be aware of the fact: there are elements in the design that slow loading time. And be sure - current customers aren’t ready to wait. \\nIf you forsake performance trying to create an incredible design your users wouldn’t wait for it and just go to your competitor. There are many research results showing the more seconds the app/page loads the more users abandon it.\\nLook at the infographic\\n<a href=\\\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/loading-time-lrg.jpg\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https://blog.kissmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/loading-time-lrg.jpg</a>\\n\\n**Fix:** It’s very important the designer is communicating with the development team. If the designer creates a great design that slows the website load the team informs him about this issue. From this angle, the work of the company is gaining an advantage in front of freelance designers. \\nAlways take into account the responsiveness of the app/website with the certain design. If your wonderful design makes the app load very long, change it or it wouldn’t convert as many customers as it could be. A good designer wouldn’t blindly follow your ideas. He would inform you about the issues that may appear. \\n\\n### Non-optimized forms\\n![forms](/blog/content/images/2019/01/forms.png)\\nEverybody encountered the situation when he or she filled in the form and suddenly, there appeared an error and the information was removed. Isn’t it annoying? Of course, yeah!\\nWould the customers patiently enter their data again? Not all of them...\\nSo, how to avoid this problem?\\n\\n**Fix:** If the form has restrictions, give a hint before the users waste their time entering information. Make additional explanations next to the form.\\nYou can give an example of the right filled-in form or a hint which appears when hovering a mouse on the form.\\n\\nLong sign-up/sign-in process belongs to this problem. If your app comes with a long sign-in or sign-up form, before it offers good products it may offer “good frustration” to the users and create a negative user experience. \\n\\nSometimes the business owners create such long obligatory forms that users don’t fill in half of them and abandon the page.\\n\\n**Fix:** Entering a website the users shouldn’t waste a lot of time searching for a login form. \\nThey shouldn’t waste half an hour filling in this form. \\nOtherwise, the negative emotions would appear at the very beginning. \\nOne of the good solutions is signing in with social media. The users sign in very quickly and you may learn some information about them from their accounts.\\nThe second solution is creating a short login form (E-mail and password only) so that the users sign in very quickly.\\n\\n### Poor navigation\\n![poor-navigation](/blog/content/images/2019/01/poor-navigation.png)\\nWhat do you know about the 3-click rule? It’s a design rule according to which the users can get to each page and find all needed info with no more than three mouse clicks. \\nAdditionally, it should be clear to the users, how they should find the necessary info. And now we have come to the next issue: the scheme of your app should be predictable and clear to the users. If they wade through your app they quickly lose interest. \\n\\n**Fix:** You should know how your audience is using your app or website. \\nIn addition to it, you should create the user flow - the path the users would make on the website reaching their goal. \\nThe website or the app should meet the user’s needs and not prevent him to accomplish his tasks.\\n\\n### Non-responsive website \\n![responsive](/blog/content/images/2019/01/responsive.png)\\nIf talking about the  <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[web development](https://2muchcoffee.com/web-development)</b></u>  you should not only pay attention to the desktop version of the website but to the mobile version, as well.\\nNowadays the users are more likely to access the website through their mobiles. You can’t imagine how many issues appear if the website isn’t developed with mobiles in mind: there are problems with the menu; the image and text size turn out to be inappropriate etc.\\n\\n**Fix:** The message is clear: create a responsive website that would adapt to any mobile platform, otherwise, your website wouldn’t look absolutely unusable in the mobile version. \\n\\n## Aesthetic issues\\n![aestethic-issues](/blog/content/images/2019/01/aestethic-issues.png)\\n### Unreadable typography \\n\\nSometimes the client wants to stand out with a new typeface on his project. So, he or she opts for very unreadable typography and is proud of his unusual app. \\nThis tendency can do a great disservice to the product.\\nRemember: If the text doesn’t contrast with the background, the letters to run together, if the typefaces have extreme slants, if the letterforms are tight and condensed, with spirals and other strange elements they can look unreadable.\\n\\n**Fix:** opt for more common typography, and consult your designer if you aren’t sure which style to choose. Choose readable typefaces for your app. You can use several typefaces: this helps to place the emphasis of the users on certain text blocks. \\nBut opting for several typefaces be careful: the inappropriately chosen font pair makes the content perception complicated. \\n\\n### Wrong images\\n\\nFirstly, don’t take overused photos, images with poor quality, as well as images which aren’t appropriate in the context. Secondly, be wary of beautiful images which have unclear meaning in the context.\\n\\n**Fix:** What is the main goal of the images? They should provide a positive user experience, inspire to make purchases or to use the app repeatedly. Don’t opt for the photo only because it’s funny and you like it. \\nThe image of the stylish woman is appropriate in the online store and the nice cats’ photo fits the pet clinic website. So you should choose appropriate images only.\\n\\n### Thrilling or pale colors\\n\\nDo you know how to scare off your users? There are so many fantastic colors in this world, why not to use all of them in your app? Then it would look like a nice rainbow.\\n\\n**Fix:** opt for a certain palette for your app or your website. Limit the palette to approximately 5 colors and shades. \\nThe colors shouldn’t be very pale or merge into one stain; the most important things should be highlighted: for example, the call-to-action buttons should have an eye-catching color but harmonize with the whole website.\\n\\n## So how to create a good UI/UX design?\\n\\nThe design should convert your customers and clients. It should create a positive experience. That’s why pay attention to creating an appealing design on the app/website so that the users would repeatedly visit it.\\n\\nFind the right designer for your startup. If the same team is creating both website/app design and front-end, the designer has the opportunity to communicate with the development team and many issues are avoided e.g. low performance because of the overloaded design. \\n\\nThe smart and creative designer can not only follow directions. He or she is a person who is about to correct your mistakes and tell you how the mobile app or a website would look better and more usable. He would give additional advice and prevent problems even if you have no clue they could exist.\\n\\nUI and UX shouldn’t be considered separately because they are two halves of the same thing. Creation of the beautiful and appealing design is a comprehensive process.\\nSo, long story short, keep the design simple, clear, appealing and readable.\\nResearch your target audience and create the user flow. Find out what helps the users to accomplish their task and what distracts them.\\n\\nTake into account the appealing colors, readable typefaces, the most important information only, quick sign-in and sign-up forms. If you are building a website remember to make a responsive one to avoid troubles in the future. Bear in mind that the minimal design is more appealing than the design overloaded with the content. Leaving the most important elements only you improve your app performance.\\n\\n <u><b>[Feel free to contact us](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u> if you want to find out how much time or money should be spent on creating your startup design.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Business owners who are ready to give life to their great ideas surely invest a lot of time and money into <u><b style=\"background-color:#CCF0EB\"><a href=\"https://2muchcoffee.com/mobile-app-development\">app development</a></b></u>, marketing strategy and ads.<br>\nBut not many of them realize how important a well thought out design is.

We saw\nmany startups fail because their implementation was so poor and the performance\nof the app was very bad. It doesn’t matter whether you create a mobile app or a\nwebsite, the beautiful and simple design enhances user engagement and the bad\ndesign makes the users abandon the app.\n\nIn this article we are going to tell how to avoid mistakes in the UI/UX design.\nReading about the web or app design in Google you find words UI/UX. Let’s\nclarify what they mean.\nUI is a user interface, and UX stands for user experience.\nAll visual components the user is interacting with: the typography, images etc.\nbelong to UI.\nTo UX belong the analytical part of the designer work, research, the target\naudience definition, competitor analysis, testing, creating user flow and user\npersona.\n\nThe appealing UI/UX design [https://2muchcoffee.com/design]  is focused on\nmaximizing usability and getting a positive user experience. Its main purpose is\nto be user-friendly for making the user's interaction simple and efficient, in\nterms of accomplishing user goal.\nThe process of the UI/UX creation is comprehensive because they are two halves\nof the same thing.\n\nOf course, firstly, you should learn and follow the steps of the app\ndevelopment. It’s not the design you start with. It’s defining your app’s goal,\nanalysing your competitors and researching the target audience.\nMore precise information on the steps for the mobile app development you find in\nthe article Mobile application development: Top 9 steps to build your startup\n[https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/9-steps-for-the-app-development/].\n\nSo why is the good UI/UX design so important?\n\n * It increases your revenue and fosters interest in the website or the app,\n   encourages to start using services or products. It doesn’t matter whether you\n   are offering products or services the users are more likely to try out using\n   the well-designed app or website.\n * The well-designed app converts users much better than a bad-designed one. The\n   conversion is completing the desired goal by a visitor on your website.\n * The user-friendly app or website provokes interest and people repeatedly use\n   it.\n * If you have an app with the bad design you may redesign it later, otherwise,\n   your project fails. As you understand it’s a money waste.\n\nMaybe you have invented a great startup but the customers can’t discover your\nideas because they are scared off with loud colors, content overload or low\nperformance.\n\nThe users nowadays have so many options to choose from that they wouldn’t wade\nthrough your app in order to search for the needed information.\n\nTable of contents\n\nGeneral problems\n\n * Visual/content overload\n * Non-predictable elements\n * Incredible design vs. low performance\n * Non-optimized form\n * Poor navigation\n * Non-responsive website\n\nAesthetic issues:\n\n * Unreadable typography\n * Wrong images\n * Thrilling or pale colors\n\nIf you are going to develop your app/ website, you should know what the\nconversion depends on. And it’s the design that makes an important contribution\nto the conversion rate.\nNow it’s time to consider the mistakes in the design creation and tell how to\nsolve them.\n\nGeneral problems\nVisual/content overload\n\nMany business owners want to include to their app as much information as\npossible.

Ability to upload images for providing the users with a clear picture of what the vendors are offering.\\n\\nThe additional functions vary and depend on the purpose of the certain system. Our team has developed different types of booking systems but in this article we are going to concentrate on one case and tell you which tech stack it has, which challenges we faced and which solutions we found.\\n\\n## Development of the online booking system for beauty salons\\n![development](/blog/content/images/2019/01/development.png)\\nAs there is a great demand for booking app development, our team also received several orders in this niche. We worked at different types of booking systems but here we are going to tell you about one case.\\n\\nWe had to develop an online booking app and to create a booking website for beauty salons. \\nThe task was to make such a system that searched for free places in the beauty salons nearby; \\nThe users would opt for a certain time and date; \\nThe occupied time should be shown in the timetable of every salon, as well. \\n\\nLet’s consider the online booking app from different directions: \\n> 1. Participants\\n> 1. Tech stack\\n> 1. Payment system\\n> 1. Subscriptions\\n> 1. Different time zones \\n\\n## 1. Participants\\n\\nIf you wonder how to make a booking app, firstly, you should think of the participants of this app. Let me tell you what three participants the booking app consists of.\\n\\n* **Vendors (beauty salon owners)** -  can leave their contacts in the portfolios, showcase images of their work in the gallery, make corrections in their timetables. The vendors should pay for the registration on the platform, and they are offered three types of subscriptions: for a month, for 3 months and for a year. \\n* **Clients** - can sign in and using geolocation they can see the next salons in the city and the free time. The clients have an ability to enter the desired time and the service they need in the search box. The clients don’t pay and use this booking system for free.\\n* **Admin** -  is able to manage all the data, can view the statistic and the information on the subscription models. Admin can see vendor profiles and has the ability to lock them. \\n\\n## 2.Tech stack\\n![tech-stack](/blog/content/images/2019/01/tech-stack.png)\\nOur choice fell on the following technologies as they are suitable for online systems. Let’s explain advantages of the chosen tech stack: \\n\\n* **Backend:**\\nFor building the backend we chose Node.js and built the backend with Node’s framework Express. Node.js is well-known for its scalability and ensures the performance and speed of the booking system. \\nA document-oriented database MongoDB was chosen as it is suitable for the document structuring and storing data. \\n* **Frontend:** \\nThe frontend of the booking system was built with the most commonly used language JavaScript, namely with its framework <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[Angular](https://2muchcoffee.com/angular-web-development)</b></u>. \\nOur company prefers using this framework because it’s one of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks which provides us with many out-of-the-box solutions. \\n\\nRead here about Angular \\n<u><b style=\\\"background-color:#CCF0EB\\\">[What are the best practices & tips when using one of the best modern frameworks?](https://2muchcoffee.com/blog/angular-web-app-development-framework/)</b></u> \\n\\n## 3.Payment system\\n![payment-system](/blog/content/images/2019/01/payment-system.png)\\nStripe was chosen as a payment system as it’s an easily integrable solution. Additionally, it provides a flexible IP-address.\\nBesides, we had to integrate the app fee - an application fee for transactions of users.\\n\\nStripe offers an easy way of integrating the subscription payments and the app fee, as well.\\nAdditionally, Stripe provides a platform with a ready easy-to-use library for Node.js and a flexible API. Due to this API the app architecture is more simple - it leads to faster development and the easier support. As a result, this solution becomes cheaper for the product owner.\\n\\n## 4.Subscriptions\\n\\nAs it was already mentioned above the salon booking system offers three types of subscriptions. They seem to be clear. \\nIf the vendor wanted to switch his plan to the other one, by default, the system offered such an algorithm: one paid plan ends and only then the second plan comes into force. \\n\\n**Challenge:** Our team faced the challenge at the moment when the product owner wanted to change this plan sequence. As soon as the vendor wanted to change his subscription model he should switch to the new one. For example, if he was using the monthly subscription plan and suddenly wanted to get 3-month-subscription model he would get the new one at once.\\nBut what about the money spent on the first model? \\n\\n**Solution:** So we had to make such an algorithm that the paid money subtracts from the new plan taking into account the number of past days and the money left is now spent on the new subscription plan. \\nEven if that sounds simple the algorithm wasn’t so easy and our team had to make sufficient changes in the code for implementing this idea. \\nAs a result, the new algorithm was implemented and the plan switch proposed by the client is functioning properly.\\n\\n## 5.Different time zones\\n![time-zones](/blog/content/images/2019/01/time-zones.png)\\nOne of our challenges was connected with time zones: the project was developed to be used in many countries with different time zones. \\n\\n**Challenge:** The system had to showcase the local time zone in the frontend when the client was booking a salon/when the vendor was creating a timetable.\\nThe backend time zone had to keep all the data for service orders in UTC time. \\n\\n**Solution:** Having analyzed the situation our team decided upon the right architecture solution. It allowed  to showcase local time in the frontend, while in the backend separately UTC time and separately time zone was stored. If the client moved to another country he could see his service orders in the local time zone.\\n\\nAs you can see, some solutions seem very simple if you are a user and see the frontend only. Such solutions are, however, challenging and time-consuming for the development team.\\nSo we have created the ability to monitor various time zones at the frontend and to keep all the data in the UTC time at the backend.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe have implemented the above-mentioned startup and for today, we continue supporting this beauty salon booking system. The good startup idea, as well as a professional implementation of this idea, appears to be the reason for the customer acquisition, engagement, and retention.\\n\\nAs you can see, some features that seem to be simple for users are not always easily implemented by the development team. Additionally, the team should always be in touch with the product owner and take care of his interests. We often face challenges in our work but always find optimal solutions for them.\\n\\nAs you understand, the theme of booking website/app development is very timely. Creating another booking website you’ll surely face other challenges and you’ll have to pass them. Choose skilled developers for your startup and be sure they will build a high-quality product for you.\\n\\nWhat questions do you have on the app development? <u><b style=\\\"background-color:#FAEC76\\\">[Write us and we’ll answer you quickly!](https://2muchcoffee.com/contacts)</b></u> \"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>In our century people are in a hurry and as a consequence, many inventions are focused on saving time.
